## Objectives:
You must implement the following formula as a function:  

$$
J( \theta) = -\cfrac{1} {m} \lbrack y \cdot \log(\hat{y}) + (\vec{1} - y) \cdot \log(\vec{1} - \hat{y})\rbrack
$$

Where:
- $\hat{y}$ is a vector of dimension $m * 1$, the vector of predicted values
- $y$ is a vector of dimension $m * 1$, the vector of expected values
- $\vec{1}$ is a vector of dimension $m * 1$, a vector full of ones.


## Instructions:
In the `vec_log_loss.py` file, write the following function as per the instructions below: 
```python
def vec_log_loss_(y, y_hat, eps=1e-15):
    """
    Compute the logistic loss value.
    Args:
        y: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
        y_hat: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
        eps: epsilon (default=1e-15)
    Returns:
        The logistic loss value as a float.
        None on any error.
    Raises:
        This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```

**Hint:** the purpose of epsilon (eps) is to avoid log(0) errors, it is a very small residual value we add to y.

## Examples:
```python
# Example 1:
y1 = np.array([1])
x1 = np.array([4])
theta1 = np.array([[2], [0.5]])
y_hat1 = logistic_predict(x1, theta1)
vec_log_loss_(y1, y_hat1)
# Output:
0.01814992791780973

# Example 2:
y2 = np.array([[1], [0], [1], [0], [1]])
x2 = np.array([[4], [7.16], [3.2], [9.37], [0.56]])
theta2 = np.array([[2], [0.5]])
y_hat2 = logistic_predict(x2, theta2)
vec_log_loss_(y2, y_hat2)
# Output:
2.4825011602474483

# Example 3:
y3 = np.array([[0], [1], [1]])
x3 = np.array([[0, 2, 3, 4], [2, 4, 5, 5], [1, 3, 2, 7]])
theta3 = np.array([[-2.4], [-1.5], [0.3], [-1.4], [0.7]])
y_hat3 = logistic_predict(x3, theta3)
vec_log_loss_(y3, y_hat3)
# Output:
2.9938533108607053
```
