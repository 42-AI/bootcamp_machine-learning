## Objectives:  
You must implement a function that shuffles a dataset and splits it in two parts: a **training set** and a **test set**.  
Your function will also shuffle and split the $y$ vector while making sure that the order of its rows matches perfectly how the features were shuffled and split. 

## Instructions:
In the `data_spliter.py` file, write the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def data_spliter(x, y, proportion):
    """Shuffles and splits the dataset (given by x and y) into a training and a test set, while respecting the indicated proportion.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimension m * n.
      y: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      proportion: has to be a float, the proportion of the dataset that will be assigned to the training set.
    Returns:
      (train_set, test_set, y_train, y_test) as a tuple of numpy.ndarray
      y_hat as a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      None if x or y are empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if x and y do not share compatible dimensions.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```

## Examples:
Be careful! The dataset has to be randomly shuffled before it is split into training and test sets. 
Unless you use the same seed in your randomization algorithm, you won't get the same results twice. The following examples are just an indication of possible outputs. As long as you have shuffled datasets with their corresponding y values, your function is working correctly.

```python
import numpy as np
x1 = np.array([1, 42, 300, 10, 59])
y = np.array([0,1,0,1,0])

# Example 1:
data_spliter(x1, y, 0.8)
# Output:
(array([  1,  59,  42, 300]), array([10]), array([0, 0, 0, 1]), array([1]))

# Example 2:
data_spliter(x1, y, 0.5)
# Output:
(array([59, 10]), array([  1, 300,  42]), array([0, 1]), array([0, 1, 0]))

x2 = np.array([ [  1,  42],
                [300,  10],
                [ 59,   1],
                [300,  59],
                [ 10,  42]])
y = np.array([0,1,0,1,0])

# Example 3:
data_spliter(x2, y, 0.8)
# Output:
(array([[ 10,  42],
        [300,  59],
        [ 59,   1],
        [300,  10]]), array([[ 1, 42]]), array([0, 1, 0, 1]), array([0]))

# Example 4:
data_spliter(x2, y, 0.5)
# Output:
(array([[59,  1],
        [10, 42]]), array([[300,  10],
        [300,  59],
        [  1,  42]]), array([0, 0]), array([1, 1, 0]))

# Be careful! The way tuples of arrays are displayed could be a bit confusing... 
# 
# Here the tuple returned contains the following arrays: 
# array([[59,  1],
#        [10, 42]])
#
# array([[300,  10],
#        [300,  59]
#
# array([0, 0])
#
# array([1, 1, 0]))
```
