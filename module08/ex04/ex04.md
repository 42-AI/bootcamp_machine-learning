## Objectives:
You must implement the following formula as a function:  

$$
\begin{matrix}
\hat{y} & = & \text{sigmoid}(X' \cdot \theta) & = & \cfrac{1} {1 + e^{-X' \cdot \theta}}    
\end{matrix}
$$

Where:
- $X$ is a matrix of dimension $m * n$, the design matrix
- $X'$ is a matrix of dimension $m * (n + 1)$, the design matrix onto which a column of $1$'s is added as a first column
- $\hat{y}$ is a vector of dimension $m * 1$, the vector of predicted values
- $\theta$ is a vector of dimension $(n + 1) * 1$, the vector of parameters

Be careful: 
- the *x* your function will get as an input corresponds to $X$, the $m * n$ matrix. Not $X'$. 
- $\theta$ is an $(n + 1) * 1$ vector. 

You have to transform *x* to fit theta's dimension!

## Instructions:
In the `log_pred.py` file, write the following function as per the instructions below: 
```python
def logistic_predict_(x, theta):
     """Computes the vector of prediction y_hat from two non-empty numpy.ndarray.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * n.
      theta: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (n + 1) * 1.
    Returns:
      y_hat as a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      None if x or theta are empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if x or theta dimensions are not appropriate.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.

```

## Examples:
```python
# Example 1
x = np.array([4])
theta = np.array([[2], [0.5]])
logistic_predict(x, theta)
# Output: 
array([[0.98201379]])

# Example 1
x2 = np.array([[4], [7.16], [3.2], [9.37], [0.56]])
theta2 = np.array([[2], [0.5]]) 
logistic_predict(x2, theta2)
# Output: 
array([[0.98201379],
       [0.99624161],
       [0.97340301],
       [0.99875204],
       [0.90720705]])

# Example 3
x3 = np.array([[0, 2, 3, 4], [2, 4, 5, 5], [1, 3, 2, 7]])
theta3 = np.array([[-2.4], [-1.5], [0.3], [-1.4], [0.7]])
logistic_predict(x3, theta3)
# Output: 
array([[0.03916572],
       [0.00045262],
       [0.2890505 ]])
```
