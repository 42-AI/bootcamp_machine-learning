## Objectives:

The time to use everything you built so far has come! Demonstrate your knowledge by implementing a logistic regression classifier using the gradient descent algorithm.
You must have seen the power of `NumPy` for vectorized operations. Well let's make something more concrete with that.

You may have had a look at Scikit-Learn's implementation of logistic regression and noticed that the **sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression** class offers a lot of options.

The goal of this exercise is to make a simplified but nonetheless useful and powerful version, with fewer options.

## Instructions:
In the `my_logistic_regression.py` file, write a `MyLogisticRegression` class as in the instructions below:
```python
class MyLogisticRegression():
	"""
	Description:
		My personnal logistic regression to classify things.
	"""
    def __init__(self, theta, alpha=0.001, n_cycle=1000):
        self.alpha = alpha
        self.max_iter = max_iter
        self.theta = theta
        # Your code here

	#... other methods ...
```
You will add the following methods:
- `fit_(self, x, y)`
- `predict_(self, x)`
- `cost_(self, x, y)`

You have already written these functions, you will just need a few adjustments so that they all work well within your `MyLogisticRegression` class.

## Examples:
```python
import numpy as np
from my_logistic_regression import MyLogisticRegression as MyLR
X = np.array([[1., 1., 2., 3.], [5., 8., 13., 21.], [3., 5., 9., 14.]])
Y = np.array([[1], [0], [1]])
mylr = MyLR([2, 0.5, 7.1, -4.3, 2.09])

# Example 0:
mylr.predict_(X)
# Output:
array([[0.99930437],
       [1.        ],
       [1.        ]])

# Example 1:
mylr.cost_(X,Y)
# Output:
11.513157421577004

# Example 2:
mylr.fit_(X, Y)
mylr.theta
# Output:
array([[ 1.04565272],
       [ 0.62555148],
       [ 0.38387466],
       [ 0.15622435],
       [-0.45990099]])

# Example 3:
mylr.predict_(X)
# Output:
array([[0.72865802],
       [0.40550072],
       [0.45241588]])

# Example 4:
mylr.cost_(X,Y)
# Output:
0.5432466580663214
```
