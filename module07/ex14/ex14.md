## Objectives:
Let's do Machine Learning for real!

## Instructions:
*  Split your `are_blue_pills_magic.csv` dataset into a training and a test set.  
*  Use your `polynomial_features` method on your training set
*  Train nine Linear Regression models with polynomial hypotheses with degrees ranging from 2 to 10.
* Evaluate your models on the test set. 

According to your model evaluations, what is the best hypothesis you can get?
