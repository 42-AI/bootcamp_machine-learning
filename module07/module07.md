# Module07 - Multivariate Linear Regression

Building on what you did on the previous modules you will extend the linear regression to handle more than one features. 
Then you will see how to build polynomial models and how to detect overfitting.

## Notions of the module
Multivariate linear hypothesis, multivariate linear gradient descent, polynomial models. 
Training and test sets, overfitting.

## Useful Ressources  
  
We strongly advise you to use the following resource:
[Machine Learning MOOC - Stanford](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/2)  
Here are the sections of the MOOC that are relevant for today's exercises: 

### Week 2: 

**Multivariate Linear Regression:**
* Multiple Features (Video + Reading)
* Gradient Descent for Multiple Variables (Video + Reading)
* Gradient Descent in Practice I- Feature Scaling (Video + Reading)
* Gradient Descent in Practice II- Learning Rate (Video + Reading)
* Features and Polynomial Regression (Video + Reading)
* Review (Reading + Quiz)

## General rules

* The Python version to use is 3.7, you can check with the following command: `python -V`
* The norm: during this bootcamp you will follow the [Pep8 standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
* The function `eval` is never allowed.
* The exercises are ordered from the easiest to the hardest.
* Your exercises are going to be evaluated by someone else, so make sure that your variable names and function names are appropriate and civil. 
* Your manual is the internet.
* You can also ask questions in the `#bootcamps` channel in [42AI's Slack workspace](https://42-ai.slack.com).
* If you find any issues or mistakes in this document, please create an issue on our [dedicated Github repository](https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_machine-learning/issues).

## Helper

Ensure that you have the right Python version.

```
> which python
/goinfre/miniconda/bin/python
> python -V
Python 3.7.*
> which pip
/goinfre/miniconda/bin/pip
```
