## Objectives:

You must implement the following formula as a function:    

$$
\nabla(J) = \frac{1}{m} {X'}^T(X'\theta - y)
$$  

Where:  
- $\nabla(J)$ is a vector of dimension $(n + 1) * 1$, the gradient vector
- $X$ is a matrix of dimension $m * n$, the design matrix
- $X'$ is a matrix of dimension $m * (n + 1)$, the design matrix onto which a column of $1$'s was added as a first column
- $\theta$ is a vector of dimension (n + 1) * 1, the parameter vector 
- $y$ is a vector of dimension m * 1, the vector of expected values
 
## Instructions:
In the `gradient.py` file, create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def gradient(x, y, theta):
    """Computes a gradient vector from three non-empty numpy.ndarray, without any for-loop. The three arrays must have the compatible dimensions.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimension m * n.
      y: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      theta: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector (n +1) * 1.
    Returns:
      The gradient as a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimensions n * 1, containg the result of the formula for all j.
      None if x, y, or theta are empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if x, y and theta do not have compatible dimensions.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```
## Examples: 
```python
import numpy as np
x = np.array([
	      [ -6,  -7,  -9],
        [ 13,  -2,  14],
        [ -7,  14,  -1],
        [ -8,  -4,   6],
        [ -5,  -9,   6],
        [  1,  -5,  11],
        [  9, -11,   8]])
y = np.array([2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19])
theta1 = np.array([3,0.5,-6])

# Example :
gradient(x, y, theta1)
# Output:
array([ -37.35714286,  183.14285714, -393.        ])

# Example :
theta2 = np.array([0,0,0])
gradient(x, y, theta2)
# Output:
array([  0.85714286,  23.28571429, -26.42857143])

```
