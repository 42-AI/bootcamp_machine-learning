## Objectives:  
Create a function that takes a vector $x$ of dimension $m * 1$ and an integer $n$ as input, and returns a matrix of dimension $m * n$.  
Each column of the matrix contains $x$ raised to the power of $j$, for $j = 1, 2, ..., n$:

$$
\begin{matrix}
x &|& x^2 &|& x^3 &|& \ldots &|& x^n
\end{matrix}
$$

## Instructions:
In the polynomial_model.py file, create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def add_polynomial_features(x, power):
    """Add polynomial features to vector x by raising its values up to the power given in argument.  
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      power: has to be an int, the power up to which the components of vector x are going to be raised.
    Returns:
      The matrix of polynomial features as a numpy.ndarray, of dimension m * n, containg he polynomial feature values for all training examples.
      None if x is an empty numpy.ndarray.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```

## Examples:
```python
import numpy as np
x = np.arange(1,6).reshape(-1, 1)

# Example 1:
add_polynomial_features(x, 3)
# Output:
array([[  1,   1,   1],
       [  2,   4,   8],
       [  3,   9,  27],
       [  4,  16,  64],
       [  5,  25, 125]])


# Example 2:
add_polynomial_features(x, 6)
# Output:
array([[    1,     1,     1,     1,     1,     1],
       [    2,     4,     8,    16,    32,    64],
       [    3,     9,    27,    81,   243,   729],
       [    4,    16,    64,   256,  1024,  4096],
       [    5,    25,   125,   625,  3125, 15625]])
```
