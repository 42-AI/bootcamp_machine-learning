**AI Classics:**   
*These exercises are key assignments from the previous module. If you haven't completed them yet, you should finish them first before you continue with today's exercises.*

## Objectives: 
* Write a class that contains all methods necessary to perform Linear Regression.

## Instructions:
In this exercise, you will not learn anything new but don't worry, it's for your own good!  
You are expected to write your own `MyLinearRegression` class which looks similar to the `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression` class:
``` python
class MyLinearRegression():
	"""
	Description:
		My personnal linear regression class to fit like a boss.
	"""
	def __init__(self, theta):
		"""
		Description:
			generator of the class, initialize self.
		Args:
			theta: has to be a list or a numpy array, it is a vector of dimension (number of features + 1, 1).
		Raises:
			This method should noot raise any Exception.
		"""
		   ... your code here ...
	... other methods ...
```

You will add the following methods:
- `predict_(self, x)` 
- `cost_elem_(self, x, y)`
- `cost_(self, x, y)`
- `fit_(self, x, y, alpha, n_cycle)`   

You have already implemented these functions, you just need a few adjustments so that they all work well within your `MyLinearRegression` class.

## Examples:
```python
import numpy as np
from mylinearregression import MyLinearRegression as MyLR
x = np.array([[12.4956442], [21.5007972], [31.5527382], [48.9145838], [57.5088733]])
y = np.array([[37.4013816], [36.1473236], [45.7655287], [46.6793434], [59.5585554]])

lr1 = MyLR([2, 0.7])

# Example 0.0:
lr1.predict(x)
# Output:
array([[10.74695094],
       [17.05055804],
       [24.08691674],
       [36.24020866],
       [42.25621131]])

# Example 0.1:
lr1.cost_elem_(lr1.predict(x),y)
# Output:
array([[77.72116511],
       [49.33699664],
       [72.38621816],
       [37.29223426],
       [78.28360514]])

# Example 0.2:
lr1.cost_(lr1.predict(x),y)
# Output:
315.0202193084312


# Example 1.0:
lr2 = MyLR([0, 0])
lr2.fit(x, y, alpha=5e-8, n_cycle = 1500000)
lr2.theta
# Output:
array([[1.40709365],
       [1.1150909 ]])

# Example 1.1:
lr2.predict(x)
# Output:
array([[15.3408728 ],
       [25.38243697],
       [36.59126492],
       [55.95130097],
       [65.53471499]])

# Example 1.2:
lr2.cost_elem_(lr1.predict(x),y)
# Output:
array([[35.6749755 ],
       [ 4.14286023],
       [ 1.26440585],
       [29.30443042],
       [22.27765992]])

# Example 1.3:
lr2.cost_(lr1.predict(x),y)
# Output:
92.66433192085971
```
