## Objectives:

You must implement the following formula as a function:  
  
$$
\lambda \sum_{j=0}^{n} \theta_{j}^2
$$

Where:  
- $\theta$ is a vector of dimensions (n+1, 1) (where n is the number of features),
- $\lambda$ is a constant.


## Instructions:

In the reg.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def regularization(theta, lambda_):
	"""Computes the regularization term of a non-empty numpy.ndarray, with a for-loop.
	Args:
		theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (n+1, 1).
		lambda: has to be a float.
	Returns:
		The regularization term of theta.
		None if theta is an empty numpy.ndarray.
	Raises:
		This function should not raise any Exception.
	"""
```


## Examples:

```python
import numpy as np
theta = np.array([0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21])

regularization(theta, 0.3)
# 284.7

regularization(theta, 0.01)
# 9.47

regularization(theta, 0)
# 0.0
```
