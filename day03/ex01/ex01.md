You must implement the following formula as a function:  
  
$$
\lambda \theta \cdot \theta = \lambda \theta^{T}\theta
$$

Where 
- $\theta$ is a vector of dimension n * 1,
- $\lambda$ is a constant


**Instructions:**
In the vec_reg.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def vectorized_regularization(theta, lambda_):
    """Computes the regularization term of a non-empty numpy.ndarray, without any for-loop.    Args:
      theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension n * 1.
      lambda: has to be a float.
    Returns:
      The regularization term of theta.
      None if theta is an empty numpy.ndarray.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```

**Examples**
```python
>>> X = np.array([0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21])
>>> vectorized_regularization(X, 0.3)
40.67142857142857
>>> vectorized_regularization(X, 0.01)
1.3557142857142856
>>> vectorized_regularization(X, 0)
0.0
```
