|   Files to turn in :    |  utils.py          |
|   Forbidden module :    |  sklearn           |

**Objective:**
The aim is to create 3 functions:
- gini that computes Gini's impurity of a dataset.
- entropy that computes Shannon's entropy of a dataset.
- information_gain that computes the information gain between two datasets.

These functions will turn out to be very useful for decision trees algorithms.


**Instruction:**
In the utils.py file, create the 3 functions as per below instructions

```python
def gini(array):
    """
    Computes the gini impurity of a non-empty numpy.ndarray
    :param numpy.ndarray array: 
    :return float: gini_impurity as a float or None if input is not a non-empty numpy.ndarray 
    """

def entropy(array):
    """
    Computes the Shannon Entropy of a non-empty numpy.ndarray
    :param numpy.ndarray array: 
    :return float: shannon's entropy as a float or None if input is not a non-empty numpy.ndarray 
    """


def information_gain(array_source, array_children_list, criterion='gini'):
    """
    Computes the information gain between the first and second array using the criterion ('gini' or 'entropy')

    :param numpy.ndarray array_source:
    :param list array_children_list: list of numpy.ndarray
    :param str criterion: Should be in ['gini', 'entropy']
    :return float: Shannon entropy as a float or None if input is not a non-empty numpy.ndarray or None if invalid input
    """

```
