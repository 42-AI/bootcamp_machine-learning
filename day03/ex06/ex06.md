## Objectives:

This exercise is almost the same as the ex03, except that $h_{\theta}(x_i)$ is now the logistic regression hypothesis instead of the linear regression one.  
$h_{\theta}(x_i) = g(\theta \cdot x_i)$ where $g$ is the sigmoid function applied to the result of $\theta \cdot x_i$.

You must implement the following formula as a function:
$$\nabla(J)_0 = \frac{1}{m}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_{\theta}(x_i) - y_i)x^{(0)}\right)$$  
$$\nabla(J)_j = \frac{1}{m}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_{\theta}(x_i) - y_i)x^{(j)} + \lambda \theta_j\right) \text{for j = 1, ..., n}$$

Where:  
- $\nabla(J)$ is a vector of dimension (n+1, 1),
- $x$ is a matrix of dimension (m, n) (i.e. a matrix containing m vectors of dimension (1, n)),
- $y$ is a vector of dimension (m, 1),
- $\theta$ is a vector of dimension (n+1, 1),
- $x_i$ is the ith component of $x$, a vector of dimension (1, n),
- $y_i$ is the ith component of $y$,
- $\nabla(J)_j$ is the jth component of $\nabla(J)$,
- $h_{\theta}(x_i)$ is the result of the sigmoid function applied to the result of the dot product of the vector $\theta$ and the vector $x_i$,
- $\alpha$ is a constant,
- $\lambda$ is a constant.


## Instructions:

In the reg_logistic_grad.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def reg_logistic_grad(y, x, theta, lambda_):
    """Computes the regularized linear gradient of three non-empty numpy.ndarray, with two for-loop. The three arrays must have compatible dimensions.
    Args:
      y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (m, 1).
      x: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimesion (m, n).
      theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (n+1, 1).
      lambda_: has to be a float.
    Returns:
      A numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (n+1, 1), containing the results of the formula for all j.
      None if y, x, or theta are empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if y, x or theta does not share compatibles dimensions.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```


## Examples:

```python
import numpy as np
X = np.array([
      	[ -6,  -7,  -9],
        [ 13,  -2,  14],
        [ -7,  14,  -1],
        [ -8,  -4,   6],
        [ -5,  -9,   6],
        [  1,  -5,  11],
        [  9, -11,   8]])
Y = np.array([1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0])
theta = np.array([0, 1.2, 0.5, -0.32])

reg_logistic_grad(Y, X, Z, 1)
# array([ 6.69780169, -0.33235792, 2.71787754])

reg_logistic_grad(Y, X, Z, 0.5)
# array([ 6.61208741, -0.3680722, 2.74073468])

reg_logistic_grad(Y, X, Z, 0.0)
# array([ 6.52637312, -0.40378649, 2.76359183])
