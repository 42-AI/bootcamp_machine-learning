**Objective:**
You must implement the following formula as a function:  
$$
x_{i}' = \frac{x_i - min(x)}{max(x) - min(x)}
$$

where:
- $x$ is a vector
- $x_i$ is the ith component of the vector $x$
- $min(x)$ is the minimum value found in the components of the vector $x$
- $max(x)$ is the maximum value found in the components of the vector $x$

**Instructions:**
In the zscore.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def minmax(x):
    """Computes the min-max standardization lambda function of a non-empty numpy.ndarray, using a for-loop.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector.
    Returns:
      The min-max standardisation lambda function, which takes a number as input and returns the normalized value of this number for the vector x.
      None if x is a non-empty numpy.ndarray.
    Raises:
      This function shouldn't raise any Exception.
    """
```

**Examples**
```python
>>> X = [0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21]
>>> m = minmax(X)
>>> m(15)
1.0
>>> m(-21)
0.0
>>> m(0)
0.5833333333333334
```
