# Classification: the art of putting labels on things
During the last three days you have implemented your first machine learning algorithm. You also discovered the three main steps on which all **learners** are build upon:   
    - Prediction  
    - Evaluation  
    - Improvement

Your first algorithm, the **multivariate linear regression** can now be used to predict a numerical values from several features using gradient descent to optimise its cost function.  

Now you are going to meet your first **classification algorithm**: the **logistic regression**. Classification task means that you are not predicting numerical values (like price, age, grades...) but **labels** (like dog, cat, sick or not...).   

**Be careful!**  
Don't be confused by the fact the name **logistic regression** contains the term *'regression'*: it is not a regression task at all!  
We are doing regular classification here. The name is a bit tricky but you will quickly get used to it.  
Once again: **logistic regression is a classification algorithm** which predicts labels for a given example.
