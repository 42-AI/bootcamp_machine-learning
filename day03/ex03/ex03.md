## Objectives:
You must implement the sigmoid function, given by the following formula:  

$$
\text{sigmoid}(x) = \cfrac{1} {1 + e^{-x}}
$$

Where:  
* $x$ is a scalar or a vector
* $e$ is a mathematical constant, named Euler's number

This function is also known as **Standard logistic sigmoid function**. This explains the name *logistic regression*.

The sigmoid function transforms an input into a probability value, i.e. a value between 0 and 1.  
This probability value will then be used to classify the inputs.  

## Instructions:
In the `sigmoid.py` file, write the following function as per the instructions below: 
```python
def sigmoid_(x):
    """
    Compute the sigmoid of a vector.
    Args:
        x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector
    Returns: 
        The sigmoid value as a numpy.ndarray.
        None if x is an empty numpy.ndarray.
    Raises:
        This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```

**Nota Bene:** if your argument is a list, the function would be applied element-wise to this list and a list of the same shape would be returned.
      
## Examples:
```python
# Example 1:
x = np.array(-4)
sigmoid_(x)
# Output:
array([0.01798620996209156])

# Example 2:
x = np.array(2)
sigmoid_(x)
# Output:
array([0.8807970779778823])

# Example 3:
x = np.array([[-4], [2], [0]])
sigmoid_(x)
# Output:
# array([[0.01798620996209156], [0.8807970779778823], [0.5]])
```
## To go further
*Our sigmoid formula is a special case of the logistic function below, with $L = 1$, $k = 1$ and $x_0 = 0$:*

$$
f(x) = \cfrac{L}{1 + e^{-k(x-x_0)}}
$$
