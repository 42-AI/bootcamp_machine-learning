## Objectives:

You must implement the following formula as a function:  
$$\nabla(J)_0 = \frac{1}{m}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_{\theta}(x_i) - y_i)x_{i}^{(j)}\right)$$  
$$\nabla(J)_j = \frac{1}{m}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_{\theta}(x_i) - y_i)x_{i}^{(j)} + \lambda \theta_j\right) \text{ for j = 1, ..., n}$$

Where:  
- $\nabla(J)$ is a vector of dimension (n+1, 1),
- $x$ is a matrix of dimension (m, n) (i.e. a matrix containing m vectors of dimension (n, 1)),
- $y$ is a vector of dimension (m, 1),
- $\theta$ is a vector of dimension (n+1, 1),
- $x_i$ is the ith component of $x$, a vector of dimension (1, n),
- $y_i$ is the ith component of $y$,
- $\nabla(J)_j$ is the jth component of $\nabla(J)$,
- $h_{\theta}(x_i)$ is the result of the dot product of the vector $\theta$ and the vector $x_i$,
- $\alpha$ is a constant,
- $\lambda$ is a constant.


## Instructions:

In the reg_linear_grad.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def reg_linear_grad(y, x, theta, lambda_):
    """Computes the regularized linear gradient of three non-empty numpy.ndarray, with two for-loop. The three arrays must have compatible dimensions.
    Args:
      y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (m, 1).
      x: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimesion (m, n).
      theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (n+1, 1).
      alpha: has to be a float.
      lambda_: has to be a float.
    Returns:
      A numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (n+1, 1), containing the results of the formula for all j.
      None if y, x, or theta are empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if y, x or theta does not share compatibles dimensions.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```


## Examples:

```python
import numpy as np
X = np.array([
	[ -6,  -7,  -9],
	[ 13,  -2,  14],
	[ -7,  14,  -1],
	[ -8,  -4,   6],
	[ -5,  -9,   6],
	[  1,  -5,  11],
	[  9, -11,   8]])
Y = np.array([2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19])
theta = np.array([0, 3, 10.5, -6])

reg_linear_grad(Y, X, theta, 1)
# array([-192.64285714, 887.5, -679.57142857])

reg_linear_grad(Y, X, theta, 0.5)
# array([-192.85714286, 886.75, -679.14285714])

reg_linear_grad(Y, X, theta, 0.0)
# array([-193.07142857, 886., -678.71428571])
```
