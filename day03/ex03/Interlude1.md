**The first step is to build a model from our hypothesis.**  
You will soon discover that our classification's hypothesis is **very close** to our previous regression's one.

Our classification hypothesis makes use of a function: the **sigmoid**.  
Please don't be frighten by this fancy name. The **sigmoid function** is just a way to **map the result of a linear regression into a range of values from 0 to 1**.
