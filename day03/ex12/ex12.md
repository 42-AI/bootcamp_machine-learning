## Objectives:

Original features do not always encapsulate the true relationships between the data and the prediction. As you have seen in some previous exercises on Linear Regression and Ridge, sometimes the relationship is better represented using non-linear parameters, like __polynomial features__, or __interraction terms__. 

- 'Polynomial feature' refers to a feature build by putting an original feature to some polynomial degree.
- 'Interraction term' refers to a feature build by multiplying together two features or more (originals or polynomials).

In such cases it is necessary to __build__ your own non-linear features by yourself. 

You will have to create a function able to produce all the polynomial features possible for a dataset up to a given polynomial degree and all the interaction terms possible for this dataset up to the given polynomial degree -1. Your function must also add an intercept column of 1 as the first column of the dataset.

Take a look at the class sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeature [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html?highlight=polynomial#sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures). 
We are doing a light mimic of it as a simple function.


## Instructions:

In the polynonial_feat.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def polynomialFeatures(x, degree=2, interaction_only= False, include_bias=True):
    """Computes the polynomial features (including interraction terms) of a non-empty numpy.ndarray.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector.
    Returns:
      The polynomial features matrix, a numpy.ndarray.
      None if x is a non-empty numpy.ndarray.
    Raises:
      This function shouldn't raise any Exception.
    """
```


## Examples:

```python
import numpy as np
X = np.arange(6).reshape(3, 2)
X
# array([[0, 1],
       [2, 3],
       [4, 5]])

polynomialFeatures(X)
# array([[ 1.,  0.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  1.],
       [ 1.,  2.,  3.,  4.,  6.,  9.],
       [ 1.,  4.,  5., 16., 20., 25.]])

polynomialFeatures(X, 3)
# array([[  1.,   0.,   1.,   0.,   0.,   1.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   1.],
       [  1.,   2.,   3.,   4.,   6.,   9.,   8.,  12.,  18.,  27.],
       [  1.,   4.,   5.,  16.,  20.,  25.,  64.,  80., 100., 125.]])

polynomialFeatures(X, 3, interaction_only=True, include_bias=False)
# array([[ 0.,  1.,  0.],
       [ 2.,  3.,  6.],
       [ 4.,  5., 20.]])
```

## To go further:
Once you have done it, expand your datasets from the previous days and test regularized version of linear and logistic regression on it. Are you able to more precise prediction?
