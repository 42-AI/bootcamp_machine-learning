## Objectives:

You must implement the following formula as a function:
$$\nabla(J) = \frac{1}{m} X^{T}(X\theta - y)$$  
$$\nabla(J)_0 := \nabla(J)_0$$  
$$\nabla(J)_j := \nabla(J)_j + \frac{\lambda}{m} \theta_j \text{ for j = 1, ..., n}$$

Where:  
- $\nabla(J)$ is a vector of dimension (n+1, 1), 
- $X$ is a matrix of dimension (m, n) (i.e. a matrix containing m vectors of dimension (1, n)),
- $y$ is a vector of dimension (m, 1),
- $\theta$ is a vector of dimension (n+1, 1),
- $\nabla(J)_j$ is the jth component of $\nabla(J)$,
- $\alpha$ is a constant,
- $\lambda$ is a constant.


## Instructions:

In the vec_reg_linear_grad.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def vec_reg_linear_grad(y, x, lambda_):
    """Computes the regularized linear gradient of three non-empty numpy.ndarray, without any for-loop. The three arrays must have compatible dimensions.
    Args:
      y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (m, 1).
      x: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimesion (m, n).
      theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (n+1, 1).
      lambda_: has to be a float.
    Returns:
      A numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (n+1, 1), containing the results of the formula for all j.
      None if y, x, or theta are empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if y, x or theta does not share compatibles dimensions.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```


## Examples:

```python
X = np.array([
	[ -6,  -7,  -9],
        [ 13,  -2,  14],
        [ -7,  14,  -1],
        [ -8,  -4,   6],
        [ -5,  -9,   6],
        [  1,  -5,  11],
        [  9, -11,   8]])
Y = np.array([2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19])
theta = np.array([0, 3, 10.5 ,-6])

vec_reg_linear_grad(Y, X, theta, 1)
# array([-192.64285714,  887.5, -679.57142857])

vec_reg_linear_grad(Y, X, theta, 0.5)
# array([-192.85714286,  886.75, -679.14285714])

vec_reg_linear_grad(Y, X, theta, 0.0)
# array([-193.07142857,  886., -678.71428571])
```
