## Objectives:

In the last exercise, you implemented of a regularized version of the linear regression algorithm, called Ridge regression. Now it is time to update your own logistic regression as well!

In the scikit-learn library, the logistic regression implementation have a regularization policy by default which can be selected using the parameter __penalty__. 

The goal of this exercise is to update your old LogisticRegressionBatchGD class to take that into account.   


## Instructions:

In the log_reg.py file change the class __LogisticRegressionBatchGD__ according to the following : 
- add a __penalty__ parameter wich can take the following values: {'l2', 'none'}, default = 'l2'.
- update the __.fit()__ method: 
    - if __penalty = 'l2'__: use a regularized version of the gradient descent.
    - if __penalty = 'none'__: use the unregularized version of the gradient descent from day02.

Now that you have done this, you will test your model with the same datasets from day02 and compare the results with and without regularization.
