## Objectives:

You must implement the following formula as a function:  
$$
x_{i}' = \frac{x_i - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i = 1}^{m} x_i}{sqrt{\frac{1}{m - 1} \sum_{i = 1}^{m} (x_i - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i = 1}^{m} x_i)^{2}}} \text{ for i in 1, ..., m}
$$

Where:  
- $x$ is a vector of dimension (m, 1),
- $x_i$ is the ith component of the vector $x$,

Which is way easier to understand in the following form:

$$
x_{i}' = \frac{x_i - \mu}{\sigma} \text{ for i in 1, ..., m}
$$

This should remind you something from day00...

Nope?  

Ok lets do a quick recap: 
- $\mu$ is the mean of $x$
- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of $x$


## Instructions:

In the zscore.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def zscore(x):
    """Computes the normalized version of a non-empty numpy.ndarray using the z-score standardization.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector.
    Returns:
      x' as a numpy.ndarray. 
      None if x is a non-empty numpy.ndarray.
    Raises:
      This function shouldn't raise any Exception.
    """
```


## Examples:

```python
import numpy as np
X = numpy.array([0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21])

zscore(X)
# array([-0.08620324,  1.2068453, -0.86203236,  0.51721942,  0.94823559,
        0.17240647, -1.89647119])

Y = np.array([2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19])

zscore(Y)
# array([ 0.11267619, 1.16432067, -1.20187941, 0.37558731, 0.98904659,
        0.28795027, -1.72770165])
```
