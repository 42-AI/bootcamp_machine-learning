## Objectives:

You must implement the following formula as a function:  

$$
regMSE = \frac{1}{m}\left((X\theta - y)^{T}(X\theta - y) + \lambda \theta \cdot \theta \right)
$$

Where:  
- $X$ is a matrix of dimension (m, n),
- $\theta$ is a vector of dimension (n+1, 1),
- $y$ is a vector of dimension (m, 1),
- $\lambda$ is a constant,


## Instructions:

In the reg_mse.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def reg_mse(y, x, theta, lambda_):
    """Computes the regularized mean squared error of three non-empty numpy.ndarray, without any for-loop. The three arrays must have compatible dimensions.
    Args:
      y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (m, 1).
      x: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimesion (m, n).
      theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (n+1, 1).
      lambda: has to be a float.
    Returns:
      The mean squared error as a float.
      None if y, x or theta are empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if y, x or theta does not share compatibles dimensions.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```


## Examples:

```python
import numpy as np
X = np.array([
	[ -6,  -7,  -9],
	[ 13,  -2,  14],
	[ -7,  14,  -1],
	[ -8,  -4,   6],
	[ -5,  -9,   6],
	[  1,  -5,  11],
	[  9, -11,   8]])
Y = np.array([2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19])
theta = np.array([0, 3, 0.5, -6])

reg_mse(Y, X, theta, 0)
# 2641.0

reg_mse(Y, X, theta, 0.1)
# 2641.6464285714287

reg_mse(Y, X, theta, 0.5)
# 2644.2321428571427
```
