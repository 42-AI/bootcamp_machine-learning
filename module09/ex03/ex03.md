## Objectives:  
Create a function that takes a matrix $X$ of dimension $m * n$ and an integer $p$ as input, and returns a matrix of dimension $m * (np)$.  
For each column $x_j$ of the matrix $X$, the new matrix contains 
$x_j$ raised to the power of $k$, for $k = 1, 2, ..., p$ :

$$
\begin{matrix}
x_1 &|& \dots &|& x_n &|& x_1^2 &|& \dots &|& x_n^2 &|& \dots &|& x_1^p &|& \dots &|& x_n^p
\end{matrix}
$$

## Instructions:
In the `polynomial_model_extended.py` file, write the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def add_polynomial_features(x, power):
    """Add polynomial features to matrix x by raising its columns to every power in the range of 1 up to the power given in argument.  
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimension m * n.
      power: has to be an int, the power up to which the columns of matrix x are going to be raised.
    Returns:
      The matrix of polynomial features as a numpy.ndarray, of dimension m * (np), containg the polynomial feature values for all training examples.
      None if x is an empty numpy.ndarray.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```

## Examples:
```python
import numpy as np
x = np.arange(1,11).reshape(5, 2)

# Example 1:
add_polynomial_features(x, 3)
# Output:
array([[   1,    2,    1,    4,    1,    8],
       [   3,    4,    9,   16,   27,   64],
       [   5,    6,   25,   36,  125,  216],
       [   7,    8,   49,   64,  343,  512],
       [   9,   10,   81,  100,  729, 1000]])

# Example 2:
add_polynomial_features(x, 5)
# Output:
array([[    1,     2,     1,     4,     1,     8,     1,    16],
       [    3,     4,     9,    16,    27,    64,    81,   256],
       [    5,     6,    25,    36,   125,   216,   625,  1296],
       [    7,     8,    49,    64,   343,   512,  2401,  4096],
       [    9,    10,    81,   100,   729,  1000,  6561, 10000]])
```
