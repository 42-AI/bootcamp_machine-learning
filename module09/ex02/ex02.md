1 - What is overfitting?

2 - What do you think underfitting might be?

4 - If a model overfits, what will happen when you compare its performance on the training set vs. its performance on the test set?

5 - If a model underfits, what do you think will happen when you compare its performance on the training set vs. its performance on the test set?
