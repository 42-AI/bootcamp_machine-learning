\section*{Interlude - Next Level: Ridge Regression}
% ============================================== %

Until now we only talked about L$_2$ regularization and its implications on the 
calculation of the loss function and gradient for both the linear and the logistic regression.\\
\\
Now it's time to use the proper terminology :\\ 
\\
\emph{When we apply L$_2$ regularization on a linear regression model, the new model is 
called a \textbf{Ridge Regression} model.
Besides that brand-new name, Ridge regression is nothing more than 
linear regression regularized with L$_2$.}\\
\\
We suggest you watch this \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q81RR3yKn30}{very nice 
explanation of Ridge Regularization}.\\
\\
By the way, this Youtube channel, \texttt{\textit{StatQuest}}, is very helpful to 
understand the gist of a lot of machine learning concepts.\\
You will not waste your time watching its statistics and machine learning playlists!
