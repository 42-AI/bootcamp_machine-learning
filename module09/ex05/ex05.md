## Objectives:
You must implement the following formula as a function:  

$$
J(\theta)  =  \frac{1}{2m}[(\hat{y} - y)\cdot(\hat{y}- y) + \lambda (\theta' \cdot \theta')]
$$  

Where:
- $y$ is a vector of dimension $m * 1$, the expected values,
- $\hat{y}$ is a vector of dimension $m * 1$, the predicted values,
- $\lambda$ is a constant, the regularization hyperparameter,
- $\theta'$ is a vector of dimension $n * 1$, constructed using the following rules:
  
$$
\begin{matrix}
\theta'_0 & =  0 \\
\theta'_j & =  \theta_j & \text{ for } j = 1, \dots, n\\    
\end{matrix}
$$

## Instructions:
In the `linear_cost_reg.py` file, write the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def reg_cost_(y, y_hat, theta, lambda_):
    """Computes the regularized cost of a linear regression model from two non-empty numpy.ndarray, without any for loop. The two arrays must have the same dimensions.
    Args:
      y: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      y_hat: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension n * 1.
      lambda_: has to be a float.
    Returns:
      The regularized cost as a float.
      None if y, y_hat, or theta are empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if y and y_hat do not share the same dimensions.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```
**Hint:** such situation is a good use case of decorators...


## Examples
```python
y = np.array([2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19])
y_hat = np.array([3, 13, -11.5, 5, 11, 5, -20])
theta = np.array([1, 2.5, 1.5, -0.9])

# Example :
reg_cost_(y, y_hat, theta, .5)
# Output:
0.8503571428571429

# Example :
reg_cost_(y, y_hat, theta, .05)
# Output:
0.5511071428571429

# Example :
reg_cost_(y, y_hat, theta, .9)
# Output:
1.116357142857143
```
