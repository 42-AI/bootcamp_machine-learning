## Objective:
Now it's time to implement your `MyRidge` class, similar to the class of the same name in `sklearn.linear_model`.

## Instructions:
In the `ridge.py` file, create the following class as per the instructions given below:

Your `MyRidge` class will have several methods:
* `__init__` , special method, identical to the one you wrote in `MyLinearRegression` (module06),
* `get_params_` , which get the parameters of the estimator, 
* `set_params_` , which set the parameters of the estimator,
* `cost_`, which return the cost between 2 vectors (numpy arrays),
* `cost_elem_`, which return a vector correspondind to the squared difference between 2 vectors (numpy arrays),
* `predict_` , which generate predictions using a linear model,
* `fit_` , which fit Ridge regression model to a training dataset.

Except for `fit_`, the methods are identical to the ones in your `MyLinearRegression` class.  
***You should consider inheritance***

The difference between `MyRidge`'s `fit_` method and the `fit_` method you implemented for your `MyLinearRegression` class is the use of a regularization term.

``` python
class MyRidge(ParentClass):
	"""
	Description:
		My personnal ridge regression class to fit like a boss.
	"""
	def __init__(self,  thetas, alpha=0.001, max_iter=1000, lambda_=0.5):
              self.alpha = alpha
              self.max_iter = max_iter
              self.thetas = thetas
			  self.lambda_ = lambda_
              ... Your code here ...

	... other methods ...
```
**Hint:** again, this is a great occasion for you to try to use decorators...
