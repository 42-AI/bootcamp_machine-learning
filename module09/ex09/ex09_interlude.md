# Interlude - Linear Regression to the Next Level: Ridge Regression

Until now we only talked about L2 regularization and its implication on the calculation of the cost function and gradient for both linear and logistic regression.  

Now it's time to use proper terminology:  
When we apply L2 regularization on a linear regression model, the new model is called a **Ridge Regression** model.  
Besides that brand-new name, Ridge regression is nothing more than that: linear regression regularized with L2. 

We suggest that you watch this nice explanation [very nice explanation of Ridge Regularization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q81RR3yKn30).   
By the way, this Youtube channel, **StatQuest**, is very good to help you understand the gist of a lot of machine learning concepts.  
You will not waste your time watching its statistics and machine learning playlists!
