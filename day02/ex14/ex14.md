## Objectives:
Lets do Machine Learning for real.

## Instructions:
*  Split your __are_blue_pills_magic.csv__ dataset into a training an a test sets.  Use your method `polynomial_features` on your training set to train a Linear Regression on it with polynomial hypothesis from power 2 to 10.

* Evaluate your models on the test set. 

According to your model evaluations, what is the best hypothesis you can get?
