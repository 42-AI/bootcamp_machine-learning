## Objective:
You must implement the following formula as a function:  

$$\hat{y} = X' \cdot \theta = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
1 & X_{1}^{(1)} & \dots & X_{1}^{(n)}\\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
1 & X_{m}^{(1)} & \dots &  X_{m}^{(n)}\end{bmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
\theta_0 \\ 
\theta_1 \\
\vdots \\
\theta_n
\end{bmatrix} 
= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
\theta_0 + \theta_{1} X_{1}^{(1)} + \dots + \theta_{n} X_{1}^{(n)}\\ 
\vdots \\ 
\theta_0 + \theta_{1} x_{m}^{(1)} + \dots + \theta_{n} X_{m}^{(n)}
\end{bmatrix} $$

Where:
- $X$ is a matrix of dimension m * n, the matrix of examples
- $X'$ is a matrix of dimension m * (n + 1), the matrix of examples onto which a column of ones is added as first column
- $\hat{y}$ is a vector of dimension m * 1, the vector of predicted values
- $\theta$ is a vector of dimension (n + 1) * 1, the vector of parameters
- $y_i$ is the *ith* component of vector $y$
- $X_i$ is the *ith* row of our matrix X, a vector of dimension n * 1
- $X^{(i)}$ is the *ith* column of our matrix X, a vector of dimension m * 1
- $X_i^{(j)}$ is the intersection of the *ith* row and the *jth* column of our matrix X, a real number


Be careful: 
- the x you will get as an input is X, the m * n matrix, and not X', the m * (n + 1) one 
- theta is an (n + 1) * 1 vector. 

You have to transform x to fit the dimension of theta!


## Instructions:
In the prediction.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def predict_(x, theta):
    """Computes the vector of prediction y_hat from two non-empty numpy.ndarray.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * n.
      theta: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (n + 1) * 1.
    Returns:
      y_hat as a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      None if x or theta are empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if x or theta dimensions are not appropriate.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```

## Examples:
```python
import numpy as np
x = np.arange(1,13).reshape((4,))

#Example 1:
theta1 = np.array([5, 0, 0, 0])
predict_(x, theta1)
# Ouput:
array([5., 5., 5., 5.])
# Do you understand why y_hat contains only 5 here?  

#Example 2:
theta2 = np.array([0, 1, 0, 0])
predict_(x, theta2)
# Output:
array([ 1.,  4.,  7., 10.])
# Do you understand why y_hat == x[:,0] here?  


#Example 3:
theta3 = np.array([-1.5, 0.6, 2.3, 1.98])
predict_(X, theta3)
# Output:
array([ 9.64, 24.28, 38.92, 53.56])


#Example 4:
theta4 = np.array([-3, 1, 2, 3.5])
predict_(x, theta4)
# Output:
array([12.5, 32. , 51.5, 71. ])
