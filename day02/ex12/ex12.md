## Objectives:  
It's plotting time!  

## Instructions:
Plot each model you built in the last exercise with the original data points.   
* From a purely intuitive point of view, which plot seems to best represent the relationship between $y$ and $x$?  
* Is it the same as the one that was considered the most accurate in the previous exercise?  
* Have a look at the plot of the model that you considered the best in the previous exercise. How does it look to you?
