## Objectives:  
It's plotting time!  

## Instructions:
* For each model you built in the last exercise, plot its hypothesis function $h(\theta)$ on top of a scatter plot of the original data points $(x,y)$. 

* Answer the following questions: 
  1. From a purely intuitive point of view, which hypothesis (i.e. which polynomial degree) seems to best represent the relationship between $y$ and $x$?  

  2. Go back to your answer for the previous exercise. What polynomial degree had you identified as the most accurate on the dataset? Is it the same one as the curve you just picked as the most representative of the relationship between $y$ and $x$?  
  
  3. Find the plot that illustrates that same hypothesis you had found was the most accurate in the previous exercise. Take a closer look at the curve. What do you think? Does it seem to properly represent the relationship between $y$ and $x$?
