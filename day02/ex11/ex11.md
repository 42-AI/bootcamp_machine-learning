## Objectives:  
It is ploting time!  

## Instructions:
Plot each model you built in the last exercise with the original data points.   
* From a purely intuitive point of vew, which plot seems to represent the relation between $y$ and $x$ the best?  
* Is it a different plot from the one evaluated as the more accurate in the previous exercise?  
* Have a look at the plot of the hypothesis evaluated as the best in the previous exercise. How does it look to you?
