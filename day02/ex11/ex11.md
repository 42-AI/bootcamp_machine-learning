**Objectives**  
It is training time!  
Lets train some polynomial models.

**Instructions :**
Take your [NEED DATASET] and train a Linear Regression on it with a polynomial hypothesis from power 2 to 10.
For each hypothesis evaluate its cost and plot all the costs given their polynomial degree.  

(Teminology alert! The polynomial degree of a polynomial expression is its bigger exponent. E.g.: The polynomial degree of $5x^3 - x^6 + 2 x^2$ is 6.)

According to your models evaluations, what is the best hypothesis you can get?

**Examples :**
```python

```
