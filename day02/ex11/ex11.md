**Objectives**  
It is training time!  
Lets train some polynomial models.

**Instructions :**
Take your [NEED DATASET] and train a Linear Regression on it with a polynomial hypothesis from power 2 to 10.
For each hypothesis evaluate its cost and plot all the costs given their polynomial degree.  

(Teminology alert! The polynomial degree of a polynomial expression is its bigger exponent. E.g.: The polynomial degree of $5x^3 - x^6 + 2 x^2$ is 6.)

According to your models evaluations, what is the best hypothesis you can get?

**Examples :**
```python
import numpy as np
x = np.array([1, 42, 300, 10, 59])

# Example 1:
data_spliter(x, 0.8)
# Output:
(array([300,   1,  59,  10]), array([42]))

# Example 2:
data_spliter(x, 0.7)
# Output:
(array([59, 10, 42]), array([300,   1]))

y = array([[ 1, 42], [300, 10], [ 59, 1], [300, 59], [10, 42]])

# Example 3:
data_spliter(y, 0.8)
# Output:
(array([[ 59,   1],
        [ 10,  42],
        [300,  10],
        [  1,  42]]), array([[300,  59]]))

# Example 4:
data_spliter(y, 0.7)
# Output:
(array([[300,  59],
        [  1,  42],
        [ 10,  42]]), array([[ 59,   1],
        [300,  10]]))

# Be careful! The way tuples of arrays are displayed is a bit confusing... 
# 
# Here the tuple returned contains the following arrays: 
# array([[300,  59],         [  1,  42],        [ 10,  42]])
# and
# array([[ 59,   1],        [300,  10]])
```
