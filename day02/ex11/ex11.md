## Objectives:  
It's training time!  
Let's train some polynomial models.

## Instructions:
Take your __are_blue_pills_magic.csv__ dataset and train Linear Regression models on it with polynomial hypotheses with degrees ranging from 2 to 10.
For each model, evaluate its cost, and then plot the cost of the models given their polynomial degree.  

**Teminology alert!**  
The polynomial degree of a polynomial expression is its higest exponent.  
E.g.: The polynomial degree of $5x^3 - x^6 + 2 x^2$ is $6$.

According to your model evaluations, what is the best hypothesis you can get?
