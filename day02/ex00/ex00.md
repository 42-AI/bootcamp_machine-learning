You must implement the following formula as a function:  

$$
f(x) = \frac{1} {1 + e^{-x}}
$$

Where:  
- x is a scalar value or a vector
- f is a function applied to x

This function is called the sigmoid function also known as standard logistic sigmoid function.<br/>
It is a special case of the logistic function below, with L=1, k=1 and x_0=0:

$$
f(x) = \frac{L}{1 + e^{-k(x-x_0)}}
$$

**Instruction:**

Create a function called `sigmoid_` which takes one argument: 
```python
def sigmoid_(x):
    """
    Computes the sigmoid of a scalar or a list
    :param x: scalar or list
    :return: sigmoid value as a scalar or list
    """
```
  - x: a scalar value or a vector
  - returns: a scalar value or a vector

N.B.: if your argument is a vector, the function would be applied element-wise to this vector and a
      vector of the same shape would be returned
      
**Output examples:**
```python
from sigmoid import sigmoid_

x = -4
print(sigmoid_(x))
# 0.01798620996209156
x = 2
print(sigmoid_(x))
# 0.8807970779778823
x = [-4, 2, 0]
print(sigmoid_(x))
# [0.01798620996209156, 0.8807970779778823, 0.5]
```
