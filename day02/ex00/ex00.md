You must implement the following formula as a function:  

$$
f(x) = \frac{1} {1 + e^{-x}}
$$

Where:  
- x is a scalar value or a vector
- f is a function applied to x

This function is called the sigmoid function also known as standard logistic sigmoid function.<br/>
It is a special case of the logistic function below, with L=1, k=1 and x_0=0:

$$
f(x) = \frac{L}{1 + e^{-k(x-x_0)}}
$$

Create a function called `sigmoid_` which takes one argument: 
  - a scalar value or a vector 

The function must return a scalar value or a vector:

N.B.: if your argument is a vector, the function would be applied element-wise to this vector and a
      vector of the same shape would be returned

```python
>>> from sigmoid import sigmoid_
>>> import numpy as np
>>> X = -4
>>> sigmoid_(X)
0.01798620996209156
>>> X = 2
>>> sigmoid_(X)
0.8807970779778823
>>> X = np.array([-4, 2, 0])
>>> sigmoid_(X)
array([0.01798621, 0.88079708, 0.5       ])
```
