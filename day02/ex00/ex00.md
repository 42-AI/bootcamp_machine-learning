## Objectives:

The goal of this first exercise is that you understand what is the sigmoid function and why it is important for logistic regression.


## Instructions:

You must implement the following formula as a function:  

$$
f(x) = \frac{1} {1 + e^{-x}}
$$

Where:  
* $x$ is a scalar or a vector
* $f$ is a function applied to $x$

This function is called the sigmoid function also known as standard logistic sigmoid function.<br>

It is a special case of the logistic function below, with $L = 1$, $k = 1$ and $x_0 = 0$:

$$
f(x) = \frac{L}{1 + e^{-k(x-x_0)}}
$$

The sigmoid function transform an input into a probability value, i.e. a value between 0 and 1.
This probability value will then be used to classify the input.


In the sigmoid.py file create the following function as per the instructions below: 
```python
def sigmoid_(x):
    """
    Compute the sigmoid of a scalar or a list.
    Args:
        x: a scalar or list
    Returns: 
        The sigmoid value as a scalar or list.
        None on any error.
    Raises:
        This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```

Nota Bene: if your argument is a list, the function would be applied element-wise to this list and a list of the same shape would be returned.


## Examples:

```python
from sigmoid import sigmoid_


x = -4
print(sigmoid_(x))
# 0.01798620996209156
x = 2
print(sigmoid_(x))
# 0.8807970779778823
x = [-4, 2, 0]
print(sigmoid_(x))
# [0.01798620996209156, 0.8807970779778823, 0.5]
```
