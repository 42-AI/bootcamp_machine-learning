## Objectives:

The goal of this exercise is to recreate the function accuracy_score of sklearn.metrics and to learn what does the accuracy represent and how to measure it.


## Instructions:

For the sake of simplicity, we will only ask you to have two parameters.

In the accuracy.py file create the following function as per the instructions below:
```python
def accuracy_score_(y_true, y_pred):
    """
    Compute the accuracy score.
    Args:
        y_true: a scalar or a numpy ndarray for the correct labels
        y_pred: a scalar or a numpy ndarray for the predicted labels
    Returns: 
        The accuracy score as a float.
        None on any error.
    Raises:
        This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```


## Examples:

```python
import numpy as np
from accuracy import accuracy_score_
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score   


# Test n.1
y_pred = np.array([1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1])
y_true = np.array([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0])
print(accuracy_score_(y_true, y_pred))
print(accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred))
# 0.5
# 0.5

# Test n.2
y_pred = np.array(['norminet', 'dog', 'norminet', 'norminet', 'dog', 'dog', 'dog', 'dog'])
y_true = np.array(['dog', 'dog', 'norminet', 'norminet', 'dog', 'norminet', 'dog', 'norminet'])
print(accuracy_score_(y_true, y_pred))
print(accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred))
# 0.625
# 0.625
```
