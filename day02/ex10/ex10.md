## Objectives:  
You must implement a function able to shuffle your dataset and then to split it in two part: a training set and a test set.  
Your function will also shuffle and split the vector y in order to match perfectly how the dataset was shuffled and split. 

## Instructions:
In the data_spliter.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def data_spliter(x, y, proportion):
    """Computes the vector of prediction y_hat from two non-empty numpy.ndarray.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimension m * n.
      y: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      proportion: has to be a float, the proportion of the dataset which must be put in the training set.
    Returns:
      (train_set, test_set, y_train, y_test) as a tuple of numpy.ndarray
      y_hat as a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      None if x or y are empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if x and y do not share compatible dimensions.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```

## Examples:
Be careful! The dataset have to me randomly shuffled before the training and test sets are selected from it.  
Therefore, the following examples would probably not give the same results as what you will got. As long as you got shuffled datasets with their corresponding y values, your function is working well.

```python
import numpy as np
x1 = np.array([1, 42, 300, 10, 59])
y = np.array([0,1,0,1,0])

# Example 1:
data_spliter(x1, y, 0.8)
# Output:
(array([  1,  59,  42, 300]), array([10]), array([0, 0, 0, 1]), array([1]))

# Example 2:
data_spliter(x1, y, 0.5)
# Output:
(array([59, 10]), array([  1, 300,  42]), array([0, 1]), array([0, 1, 0]))

x2 = np.array([ [  1,  42],
                [300,  10],
                [ 59,   1],
                [300,  59],
                [ 10,  42]])
y = np.array([0,1,0,1,0])

# Example 3:
data_spliter(x2, y, 0.8)
# Output:
(array([[ 10,  42],
        [300,  59],
        [ 59,   1],
        [300,  10]]), array([[ 1, 42]]), array([0, 1, 0, 1]), array([0]))

# Example 4:
data_spliter(x2, y, 0.5)
# Output:
(array([[59,  1],
        [10, 42]]), array([[300,  10],
        [300,  59],
        [  1,  42]]), array([0, 0]), array([1, 1, 0]))

# Be careful! The way tuples of arrays are displayed could be a bit confusing... 
# 
# Here the tuple returned contains the following arrays: 
# array([[59,  1],
#        [10, 42]])
#
# array([[300,  10],
#        [300,  59]
#
# array([0, 0])
#
# array([1, 1, 0]))
```
