|                         |                         |
| -----------------------:| ----------------------- |
|   Turning directory :   |  ex10                   |
|   Files to turn in :    |  f1_score.py            |
|   Forbidden function :  |  None                   |
|   Remarks :             |  n/a                    |

The goal of this exercise is to recreate the function f1_score of sklearn.metrics.

For the sake of simplicity, we will only ask you to have two parameters.

```python
def f1_score_(y_true, y_pred):
```
- y_true: ground truth (correct) labels<br>
- y_pred: predicted labels, as returned by a classifier<br>
- returns: the f1 score, a float

```python
>>> from f1_score import f1_score_
>>> y_true = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
>>> y_pred = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
>>> f1_score_(y_true, y_pred)
0.5
```
