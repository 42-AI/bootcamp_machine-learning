The goal of this exercise is to recreate the function precision_score of sklearn.metrics.

For the sake of simplicity, we will only ask you to have two parameters.

**Instruction:**

Create a function called `recall_score_` which takes two arguments: 
```python
def recall_score_(y_true, y_pred):
    """
    :param y_true: a scalar or a vector for the correct labels
    :param y_pred: a scalar or a vector for the predicted labels
    :return: the recall score as a float
    """
```

**Output examples:**
```python
>>> from recall import recall_score_
>>> y_pred = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
>>> y_true = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
>>> recall_score_(y_true, y_pred)
0.6666666666666666
```
