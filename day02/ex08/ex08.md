## Objectives:  
It is training time!  
Lets train some polynomial models.

## Instructions:
Take your [NEED DATASET] and train a Linear Regression on it with polynomial hypothesis from power 2 to 10.
For each hypothesis evaluate its cost and plot all the costs given their polynomial degree.  

(Teminology alert! The polynomial degree of a polynomial expression is its bigger exponent. E.g.: The polynomial degree of $5x^3 - x^6 + 2 x^2$ is 6.)

According to your model evaluations, what is the best hypothesis you can get?

## Examples:
```python
import numpy as np
x = np.arange(1,6)
y = np.array([3.74013816, 3.61473236, 4.57655287, 4.66793434, 5.95585554])

```
