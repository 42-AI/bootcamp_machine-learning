**Objectives :** 
* Be able to explain what is a fit in the machine learning context.
* Be able to implement a funcion which will perform a linear gradient descent (LGD).


**Instructions :**
You are expected to code a function named __fit\___ as per the instructions bellow:
``` python
def fit_(x, y, theta, alpha, n_cycles):
	"""
	Description:
		Performs a fit of y(output) with respect to x.
	Args:
		theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (n + 1) * 1: (number of features + 1, 1).
		x: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimension m * n: (number of training examples, number of features).
		y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1: (number of training examples, 1).
		alpha: has to be a float, the learning rate
		n_cycles: has to be an int, the number of iterations done during the gradient descent
	Returns:
		new_theta: numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (number of the features +1,1).
		None if there is a matching dimension problem.
	Raises:
		This function should not raise any Exception.
	"""
		... your code here ...
```
Hopefully, you have already code a function to calculate the linear gradient (you might have forgot, but you really did this).

**Examples :**
```python
>>>import numpy as np
>>>X2 = np.array([[0.2, 2., 20.], [0.4, 4., 40.], [0.6, 6., 60.], [0.8, 8., 80.]])
>>>Y2 = np.array([[19.6], [-2.8], [-25.2], [-47.6]])
>>>theta2 = np.array([[42.], [1.], [1.], [1.]])
>>>theta2 = fit_(X2, Y2, theta2,  alpha = 0.0005, n_cycle=42000)
>>>theta2
array([[41.99..],[0.97..], [0.77..], [-1.20..]])
>>>predict_(X2, theta2)
array([[19.5992..], [-2.8003..], [-25.1999..], [-47.5996..]])
```


**Remarks :**
You can generate other examples by choosing arbitrary x array and declare y as linear expression of the x columns. Notice also that you can have the components of theta becoming "[nan]". In that case it means you probably used a too big learning rate.


**Questions :**
Be sure to understand the underlying concepts and be able to answer those questions during your evaluation:
* Can you explain the different steps in the fit method (hint: you have to talk about J, it gradient and the theta)?
* What happens if you choose a too big learning rate ?
* What can you say if you choose a very small learning rate and a reasonnable number of cycles ?
