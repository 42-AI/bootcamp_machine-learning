**Objectives**  
Create a function which takes a vector x of dimension m * 1 and an integer n as input and produce a matrix of dimension m * n.  
Each new column of the matrix contains component of x raised to a power up to n. 

**Instructions :**
In the polynomial_model.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def add_polynomial_features(x, power):
    """Computes a gradient vector from three non-empty numpy.ndarray, without any for-loop. The three arrays must have the compatible dimensions.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      power: has to an int, the power up to which the components of vector x are going to be raised.
    Returns:
      The matrix of polynomial features as a numpy.ndarray, of dimensions m * n, containg the result of the formula for all j.
      None if x is an empty numpy.ndarray.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```

**Examples :**
```python
