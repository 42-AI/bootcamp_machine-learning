## Objectives:  

Learn how to split a dataset into a **training set** and a **test set**.

## Instructions:
You must implement a function that **shuffles** and **splits** a dataset it in two parts: a **training set** and a **test set**.  
- Your function will shuffle and split the $X$ matrix while keeping a certain **proportion** of the examples for training, and the rest for testing.  
- Your function will also shuffle and split the $y$ vector while making sure that the order of the rows in the output match the order of the rows in the split $X$ output.


In the data_spliter.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def data_spliter(x, y, proportion):
    """Shuffles and splits the dataset (given by x and y) into a training and a test set, while respecting the given proportion of examples to be kept in the traning set.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimension m * n.
      y: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      proportion: has to be a float, the proportion of the dataset that will be assigned to the training set.
    Returns:
      (x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test) as a tuple of numpy.ndarray
      None if x or y is an empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if x and y do not share compatible dimensions.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```
### Be careful! 
- The dataset has to be randomly shuffled _before_ it is split into training and test sets. 
- Unless you use the same seed in your randomization algorithm, you won't get the same results twice. 

## Examples:
The following examples are just an indication of possible outputs. As long as you have shuffled datasets with their corresponding y values, your function is working correctly.
```python
import numpy as np
x1 = np.array([1, 42, 300, 10, 59])
y = np.array([0,1,0,1,0])

# Example 1:
data_spliter(x1, y, 0.8)
# Output:
(array([  1,  59,  42, 300]), array([10]), array([0, 0, 0, 1]), array([1]))

# Example 2:
data_spliter(x1, y, 0.5)
# Output:
(array([59, 10]), array([  1, 300,  42]), array([0, 1]), array([0, 1, 0]))

x2 = np.array([ [  1,  42],
                [300,  10],
                [ 59,   1],
                [300,  59],
                [ 10,  42]])
y = np.array([0,1,0,1,0])

# Example 3:
data_spliter(x2, y, 0.8)
# Output:
(array([[ 10,  42],
        [300,  59],
        [ 59,   1],
        [300,  10]]), array([[ 1, 42]]), array([0, 1, 0, 1]), array([0]))

# Example 4:
data_spliter(x2, y, 0.5)
# Output:
(array([[59,  1],
        [10, 42]]), array([[300,  10],
        [300,  59],
        [  1,  42]]), array([0, 0]), array([1, 1, 0]))

# Be careful! The way tuples of arrays are displayed could be a bit confusing... 
# 
# In the last example, the tuple returned contains the following arrays: 
# array([[59,  1],
#        [10, 42]])
#
# array([[300,  10],
#        [300,  59]
#
# array([0, 0])
#
# array([1, 1, 0]))
```
