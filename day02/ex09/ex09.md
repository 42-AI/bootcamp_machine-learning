|   Files to turn in :    |  recall.py              |

The goal of this exercise is to recreate the function precision_score of sklearn.metrics.

For the sake of simplicity, we will only ask you to have two parameters.

```python
def recall_score_(y_true, y_pred):
```
- y_true: ground truth (correct) labels<br>
- y_pred: predicted labels, as returned by a classifier<br>
- returns: the recall score, a float

```python
>>> from recall import recall_score_
>>> y_pred = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
>>> y_true = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
>>> recall_score_(y_true, y_pred)
0.6666666666666666
```
