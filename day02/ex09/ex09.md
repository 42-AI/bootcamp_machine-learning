| -----------------------:| ----------------------- |
|   Turning directory :   |  ex10                   |
|   Files to turn in :    |  f1_score.py            |
|   Forbidden function :  |  None                   |

The goal of this exercise is to recreate the function f1_score of sklearn.metrics.

For the sake of simplicity, we will only ask you to have two parameters.

**Instruction:**

Create a function called `f1_score_` which takes two arguments: 
```python
def f1_score_(y_true, y_pred):
    """
    :param y_true: a scalar or a vector for the correct labels
    :param y_pred: a scalar or a vector for the predicted labels
    :return: the f1 score as a float
    """
```

**Output examples:**
```python
>>> from f1_score import f1_score_
>>> y_true = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
>>> y_pred = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
>>> f1_score_(y_true, y_pred)
0.5
```
