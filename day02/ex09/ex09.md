## Objectives:  
It is training time!  
Lets train some polynomial models.

## Instructions:
Take your __are_blue_pills_magic.csv__ dataset and train a Linear Regression on it with polynomial hypothesis from power 2 to 10.
For each hypothesis evaluate its cost and plot all the costs given their polynomial degree.  

**Teminology alert!**  
The polynomial degree of a polynomial expression is its bigger exponent. E.g.: The polynomial degree of $5x^3 - x^6 + 2 x^2$ is $6$.

According to your model evaluations, what is the best hypothesis you can get?
