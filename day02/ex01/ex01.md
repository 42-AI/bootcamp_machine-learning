## AI Key Notions: 
*These questions highlight key notions from the previous days. They are mandatory to continue your learning. You should not try to go further if you can't answer them right now.*

Are you able to clearly and simply explain:  

1 - What is a hypothesis and what is its goal? (It't a second chance for you to say something intelligible, no need to thank me!)  

2 - What is the cost function and what does it represent?  

3 - What is the linear gradient descent and what does it do?  (hint: you have to talk about _J_, its gradient and _theta_)

4 - What happens if you choose a learning rate that is too large?

5 - What happens if you choose a very small learning rate and a reasonable number of cycles?

6 - Can you explain MSE and what it spots?
