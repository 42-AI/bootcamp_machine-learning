## AI Key Notions: 
*These questions highlight key notions from the previous days. Making sure you can formulate a clear answer to each of them is necessary before you keep going. Discuss them with a fellow student if you can.*

Are you able to clearly and simply explain:  

1 - What is a *hypothesis* and what is its goal? (It's a second chance for you to say something intelligible, no need to thank me!)  

2 - What is a *cost function* and what does it represent?  

3 - What is *linear gradient descent* and what does it do?  (hint: you have to talk about _J_, its gradient and _theta_)

4 - What happens if you choose a *learning rate* that is too large?

5 - What happens if you choose a very small *learning rate* and a *reasonable number* of cycles?

6 - Can you explain *MSE* and what it measures?
