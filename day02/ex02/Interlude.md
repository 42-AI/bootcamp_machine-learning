## To the multivariate universe and beyond!

Until now we used only very simple hypothesis: $h_{\theta}(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x$. From this very simple hypothesis we have find a way to evaluate and improve our initial hypothesis.   
But we are living a complex world, full of complex phenomenons.  
How to build a model where hundreds or even thousands of parameters are involved?  
Such cases are called **multivariate models**. We are going to study them today.
