You must implement the following formula as a function:  
  
![image info](../assets/ridge.png)

$$\lamda \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_{j}^2$$

Where 
- ![image info](../assets/theta.png) is a vector of length n,
- \lambda is a constant

Create a function called `ridge` which takes two arguments: 
- an array which correspond to the vector \theta in the previous formula
- a double which correspond to \lambda in the previous formula

The function return a double, using a for loop.

```python
>>> X = [0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21]
>>> ridge(X, 0.5)
474.5
```
