**AI Classics:**  
*These exercises are key assignments from the previous day. If you haven't completed them yet, you should finish them first before you continue with today's exercises.*

## Objectives:
The time to use everything you built so far has come! Demonstrate your knowledge by implementing a logistic regression classifier using the gradient descent algorithm.
You must have seen the power of numpy for vectorized operations. Well let's make something more concrete with that.

The most curious among you may have noticed that **sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression** class offers a lot of options.

The goal of this exercise is to make a simplified but nonetheless useful and powerful version with fewer options.

## Instructions:
In the my_logistic_regression.py file create the following class with the following methods as per the instructions below:
```python
class MyLogisticRegression():
	"""
	Description:
		My personnal logistic regression to classify things.
	"""
    def __init__(self, thetas, alpha=0.001, n_cycle=1000):
        self.alpha = alpha
        self.max_iter = max_iter
        self.thetas = thetas
        # Your code here

	#... other methods ...
```
You will add the following methods:
- **fit_(self, x, y)**
- **predict_(self, x)** 
- **cost_(self, x, y)**

You have already coded these functions, you just need a few adjustments so that they all work well whithin your **MyLogisticRegression** class.

## Examples:
```python
import numpy as np
from my_logistic_regression import MyLogisticRegression as MyLR
X = np.array([[1., 1., 2., 3.], [5., 8., 13., 21.], [3., 5., 9., 14.]])
Y = np.array([[1], [0], [1]])
mylr = MyLR([2, 0.5, 7.1, -4.3, 2.09])

# Example 0:
mylr.predict_(X)
# Output:
array([[0.99930437],
       [1.        ],
       [1.        ]])

# Example 1:
mylr.cost_(X,Y)
# Output:
11.513157421577004

# Example 2:
mylr.fit_(X, Y)
mylr.thetas
# Output:
array([[ 1.04565272],
       [ 0.62555148],
       [ 0.38387466],
       [ 0.15622435],
       [-0.45990099]])

# Example 3:
mylr.predict_(X)
# Output:
array([[0.72865802],
       [0.40550072],
       [0.45241588]])

# Example 4:
mylr.cost_(X,Y)
# Output:
0.5432466580663214
