## Objectives:

The aim of this exercise is to code a simplified version of Sklearn's DecisionTreeClassifier.
This part focuses on the fit function, which trains a Decision tree on a given dataset.


## Instructions:

Fill in the DecisionTreeClassifier class. You can import the Node class from the node.py file. Feel free to use it, amend it or not. 
Please note that depending on a few implementation choices, the output can be different. As you may have seen decision trees
can have a high variance. Try to figure out why.
Feel free to add other methods and functions that you write (you can reuse the information_gain function that you already created).


```python
import pandas as pd
from node import Node


class DecisionTreeClassifier:
    def __init__(self, criterion='gini', max_depth=10):
        """
        Args:
	    criterion: str which should be in ['gini', 'entropy'].
            max_depth: max_depth of the tree (Decision tree creation stops splitting a node if node.depth >= max_depth).
        """
        self.root = None  # Root node of the tree
        # Your code here. You can add more things if needed

    def fit(self, X, y):
        """ Build the decision tree from the training set (X, y).
	The training set has m data_points (examples).
        Each of them has n features.
        Args:
            X: a pandas.Dataframe representing the training input of dimension m x n.
            y: a pandas.Dataframe representing the labels (m x 1).
        Returns:
	     object self: Trained tree.
	Raises:
	    This method should not raise any Exception.
        """
        # Your code here. You can add more things if needed


if __name__ == '__main__':
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris 
    # sklearn is not allowed in the classes.

    # Test on iris dataset
    iris = load_iris()
    X = pd.DataFrame(iris.data)
    y = pd.DataFrame(iris.target)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, train_size=0.7, random_state=1)

    dec_tree = DecisionTreeClassifier()
    dec_tree.fit(X_train, y_train)
    root = dec_tree.root
    print("TEST ON IRIS DATASET")
    print("Root split info = 'Feature_{}{}{}'\n".format(root.split_feature, root.split_kind, root.split_criteria))
    print("5 first lines of the labels of the left child of root =\n{}\n".format(root.left_child.y.head()))
    print("5 first lines of the labels of the right child of root =\n{}".format(root.right_child.y.head()))
```


## Examples:

```bash
TEST ON IRIS DATASET
Root split info = 'Feature_2 <= 1.9'

5 first lines of the labels of the left child of root =
    0
18  0
4   0
45  0
39  0
36  0

5 first lines of the labels of the right child of root =
     0
118  2
59   1
117  2
139  2
107  2

```
