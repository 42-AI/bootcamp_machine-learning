## Objectives:

You must implement the following formula as a function : 

$$
G(X) = 1 - \sum_{i = 1}^{C} p_{i}^2 
$$

Where:  
- $X$ is a vector of dimension N * 1
- $C$ is the number of different classes found among X's components 
- $p_i$ is the probability of class $i$ in X: $p_i = \frac{n}{N}$ where $n$ is the number of components of $X$ belonging to class $i$


## Instructions:

In the entropy.py file, create the function as per the instructions given below:

```python
def gini(X):
    """
    Computes the gini impurity of a non-empty numpy.ndarray.
    Args:
        X: a non-empty numpy.ndarray array.
    Returns:
        G: gini_impurity as a float.
	None if X is an empty numpy.ndarray.
    Raises:
        This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```

## Examples:

```bash
Gini impurity for [] is None
Gini impurity for {1, 2} is None
Gini impurity for bob is None
Gini impurity for [0 0 0 0 0 0] is 0.0
Gini impurity for [6] is 0.0
Gini impurity for ['a' 'a' 'b' 'b'] is 0.5
Gini impurity for ['0' '0' '1' '0' 'bob' '1'] is 0.6111111111111112
Gini impurity for [0 0 1 0 2 1] is 0.6111111111111112
Gini impurity for ['0' 'bob' '1'] is 0.6666666666666667
Gini impurity for [1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.] is 0.0
Gini impurity for [0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.] is 0.18
Gini impurity for [0 0 1] is 0.4444444444444445
```
