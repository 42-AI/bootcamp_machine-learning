## Objectives:  
It's training time!  
Let's practice our updated Logistic Regression over train some polynomial model.

## Instructions:

- Take your `solar_system_census.csv` dataset and train **ten** separate Logistic Regression models with polynomial hypotheses with **degree 3**. The Logistic Regression models will be  trained using a range [0, 1] of values for $\lambda$. Use one_vs-all method.
- Evaluate the cost of each of the ten models.  
- To properly visualize your results, make a bar plot showing the cost of the models given their $\lambda$ value.   

According to your evaluations, what is the best hypothesis (or model) you can get?
