## Objectives:  
It's training time!  
Let's practice our updated Logistic Regression with polynomial models.

## Instructions:

### Part 1: Split the Data

Take your `solar_system_census.csv` dataset and split it in a **training set** and a **test set**.

### Part 2: Train different models
- Train **ten** different Logistic Regression models with a polynomial hypothesis of **degree 3**. The models will be trained with different $\lambda$ values, ranging from 0 to 1. Use one-vs-all method.
- Evaluate the **f1 score** of each of the ten models on the test set. You can use the `f1_score_` function that you wrote in the `ex11` of `day03`.
- To properly visualize your results, make a bar plot showing the score of the models given their $\lambda$ value.   

According to your evaluations, what is the best hypothesis (or model) you can get?
