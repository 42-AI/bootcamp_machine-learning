# Day04 - Decision Tree

This day aims to present a different kind of ML algorithm: Decision Trees.
Decision Trees are historically quite popular as demonstrating the thought process of the algorithm when 
making a prediction is easy. They are also the base of more complex algorithms (random trees...) that are higly efficient.

If you don't have the time to recode everything try to grasp at least the key concepts in order to be able to use them wisely in the future.


## Notions of the day

* Gini impurity
* Shannon entropy
* Information gain. 
* Decision trees.

## General rules

* The version of Python to use is 3.7, you can check the version of Python with the following command: `python -V`
* The norm: during this bootcamp you will follow the Pep8 standards https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
* The function eval is never allowed.
* The exercises are ordered from the easiest to the hardest.
* Your exercises are going to be evaluated by someone else, so make sure that your variable names and function names are appropriate and civil. 
* Your manual is the internet.
* You can also ask questions in the dedicated channel in the 42 AI Slack: 42-ai.slack.com.
* If you find any issue or mistakes in the subject please create an issue on our dedicated repository on Github:  https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_machine-learning/issues.

## Helper 

Ensure that you have the right Python version.

```
> which python
/goinfre/miniconda/bin/python
> python -V
Python 3.7.*
> which pip
/goinfre/miniconda/bin/pip
```
