## Objectives:
You must implement the following formula as a function:  

$$
J( \theta) = -\frac{1} {m} \lbrack y \cdot \log(\hat{y}) + (\vec{1} - y) \cdot \log(\vec{1} - \hat{y})\rbrack + \frac{\lambda}{2m} (\theta' \cdot \theta')
$$

Where:
- $\hat{y}$ is a vector of dimension $m * 1$, the vector of predicted values,
- $y$ is a vector of dimension $m * 1$, the vector of expected values,
- $\vec{1}$ is a vector of dimension $m * 1$, a vector full of ones,
- $\lambda$ is a constant, the regularization hyperparameter,
- $\theta'$ is a vector of dimension $n * 1$, constructed using the following rules: 
$$
\begin{matrix}
\theta'_0 & =  0 \\
\theta'_j & =  \theta_j & \text{ for } j = 1, \dots, n\\    
\end{matrix}
$$

## Instructions:
In the `logistic_cost_reg.py` file, write the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def reg_log_cost_(y, y_hat, theta, lambda_):
    """Computes the regularized cost of a logistic regression model from two non-empty numpy.ndarray, without any for loop. The two arrays must have the same dimensions.
    Args:
      y: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      y_hat: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension n * 1.
      lambda_: has to be a float.
    Returns:
      The regularized cost as a float.
      None if y, y_hat, or theta is empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if y and y_hat do not share the same dimensions.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```
**Hint:** this is a great occasion to practice using decorators...


## Examples
```python
y = np.array([1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0])
y_hat = np.array([.9, .79, .12, .04, .89, .93, .01])
theta = np.array([1, 2.5, 1.5, -0.9])

# Example :
reg_log_cost_(y, y_hat, theta, .5)
# Output:
0.43377043716475955

# Example :
reg_log_cost_(y, y_hat, theta, .05)
# Output:
0.13452043716475953

# Example :
reg_log_cost_(y, y_hat, theta, .9)
# Output:
0.6997704371647596
```
