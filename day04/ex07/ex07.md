## Objectives:

The aim is to understand some key points of Decision Trees for regression.


## Instructions:

In the answers.txt file, answer the following questions in 3 sentences maximum. The idea is to understand the underlying concepts. These are simple questions (no traps!)
1) How do the Decision Trees for regression work?
2) Is it still appropriate to use Shannon's entropy or Gini's coefficient? If not, what measure do we use instead, when dealing with regression?
3) For a regression task, when is it better to use a Decision Tree than linear regression?
