**Objective:**

The aim is to understand some key points of decision trees.



**Instruction:**

In the answers.txt file, answer the following questions in 3 sentences maximum. The idea is to understand the underlying concepts. These are simple questions (no traps!)
1) What are the pros of using decision trees?
2) What are the cons of using decision trees? 
3) What is overfitting? How does it apply to decision trees?  
4) What can be done to avoid overfitting in decision trees?
5) What is the random_state parameter for?
6) What is the name of the algorithm used by sklearn for classification decision trees?
