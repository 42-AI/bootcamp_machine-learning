You must implement the following formula as a function:
$$\nabla(J) = \frac{\alpha}{m} X^{T}(X\theta - y)$$  
$$\nabla(J)_0 := \nabla(J)_0$$  
$$\nabla(J)_j := \nabla(J)_j + \frac{\lambda}{m} \theta_j$$

where  
- $\nabla(J)$ is a vector of dimension n * 1   
- $x$ is a matrix of dimension m * n (i.e. a matrix containing m vectors of dimension n * 1)  
- $y$ is a vector of dimension m * 1 
- $\theta$ is a vector of dimension n * 1   
- $x_i$ is the ith component of $x$, a vector of dimension n * 1
- $y_i$ is the ith component of $y$
- $\nabla(J)_j$ is the jth component of $\nabla(J)$
- $h_{\theta}(x_i)$ is the result of the dot product of the vector $\theta$ and the vector $x_i$
- $\alpha$ is a constant
- $\lambda$ is a constant


**Instructions:**
In the vec_reg_linear_grad.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def vec_reg_linear_grad(y, x, theta, alpha, lambda_):
    """Computes the regularized linear gradient of three non-empty numpy.ndarray, without any for-loop. The three arrays must have compatible dimensions.
    Args:
      y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      x: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimesion m * n.
      theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension n * 1.
      alpha: has to be a float.
      lambda_: has to be a float.
    Returns:
      A numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension n * 1, containing the results of the formula for all j.
      None if y, x, or theta are empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if y, x or theta does not share compatibles dimensions.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```

**Examples**
```python
>>> X = np.arange(21).reshape((7,3))
>>> X
array([[ 0,  1,  2],
       [ 3,  4,  5],
       [ 6,  7,  8],
       [ 9, 10, 11],
       [12, 13, 14],
       [15, 16, 17],
       [18, 19, 20]])
>>> Y = [2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19]
>>> th = np.ones(3) * 0.5
>>> vec_reg_linear_grad(X, Y, th, 0.1)
array([207.42857143, 221.72142857, 236.00714286])
>>> vec_reg_linear_grad(X, Y, th * 2, 0.05)
array([396.42857143, 425.72142857, 455.00714286])
