# Linear Regression to the next level: Ridge Regression

Until now we only talked about the L2 regularization and its implication on the calculations of the cost functions and gradients for both linear and logistic regression.  

It is time to use proper terminology.  
When we apply L2 regularization on linear regression model, the new model is called a **Ridge Regression**.  
Bessides that brad new name, a Ridge regression is nothing more than that: a linear regression regularized with L2.
