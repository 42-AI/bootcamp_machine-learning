## Objectives:
Now it is time to implement your class `MyRidge`,  similar to the class of the same name in **sklearn.linear_model**.

## Instructions:
In the ridge.py file create the following class as per the instructions given below:

Your class `MyRidge`  will have several methods:
* `__init__` , special method, identical to the one of the class `MyLinearRegression` (Day01),
* `get_params_` , which get the parameters of the estimator, 
* `set_params_` , which set the parameters of the estimator,
* `predict_` , which predict output using a linear model,
* `fit_` , which fit Ridge regression model

Except for `.fit_` the methods are identicals to the ones of your class `MyLinearRegression`.
***You should consider inheritance***

The difference between the method `.fit_` of `MyRidge` class and the method `.fit_` of `MyLinearRegression` is the use of a regularization term.

``` python
class MyRidge(ParentClass):
	"""
	Description:
		My personnal ridge regression class to fit like a boss.
	"""
	def __init__(self,  thetas, alpha=0.001, n_cycle=1000, lambda_=0.5):
              self.alpha = alpha
              self.max_iter = max_iter
              self.thetas = thetas
			  self.lambda_ = lambda_
              # Your code here

	#... other methods ...
```
Now that you have done this, you will test your model with the same datasets from day02 and compare the results with and without regularization.  

Have a look at what you got is you do it using polynomial features.
