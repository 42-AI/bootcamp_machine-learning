**It is plot time again!**

## Objective:
You must implement a function which plots the data, the prediction line, and the cost.  
You will plot the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of all data points as well as the prediction line generated by your theta parameters.
Your function must also indicate the overall cost in the title, and draw small lines marking the distance between each data point and its predicted value.


## Instructions:
In the plot.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def plot_with_cost(x, y, theta):
    """Plot the data and prediction line from three non-empty numpy.ndarray.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      y: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      theta: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension 2 * 1.
    Returns:
        Nothing.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```

## Examples:
```python
import numpy as np
x = np.arange(1,6)
y = np.array([11.52434424, 10.62589482, 13.14755699, 18.60682298, 14.14329568])

#Example 1:
theta1= np.array([18,-1])
plot_with_cost(x, y, theta1)
# Output:
```

```python
#Example 2:
theta2 = np.array([14, 0])
plot_with_cost(x, y, theta2)
# Output:
```

```python
#Example 3:
theta3 = np.array([12, 0.8])
plot_with_cost(x, y, theta3)
# Output:
```
