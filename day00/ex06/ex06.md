It is plot time!

By the way, the kind of tasks we are performing here is called a **regression** because we are predicting continuous numerical values.


**Objective:**
You must implement a function plot the data and the prediction line.  
You will plot the data given its x and y values and the prediction line based on the x and theta.


**Instructions:**
In the plot.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def plot(x, y, theta):
    """Plot the data and prediction line from three non-empty numpy.ndarray.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      y: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      theta: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension 2 * 1.
    Returns:
        Nothing.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```

**Examples**
```python
import numpy as np
x = np.arange(1,6)
y = np.array([3.74013816, 3.61473236, 4.57655287, 4.66793434, 5.95585554])

#Example 1:
theta1 = np.array([4.5, -0.2])
plot(x, y, theta1)
# Output:
```

```python
#Example 2:
theta2 = np.array([-1.5, 2])
plot(x, y, theta2)
# Output:
```

```python
#Example 3:
theta3 = np.array([3, 0.3])
plot(x, y, theta3)
# Output:
```
