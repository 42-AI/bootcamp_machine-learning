## Objectives:

You must implement the following formula as a function:  
  
$$
x \cdot y = x^{T}y = \sum_{i = 1}^{m} x_i y_i
$$

Where:  
- $x$ is a vector of dimension (m, 1),
- $y$ is a vector of dimension (m, 1),
- $x_i$ is the ith component of the vector $x$,
- $y_i$ is the ith component of the vector $y$.


## Instructions:

In the dot.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def dot(x, y):
    """Computes the dot product of two non-empty numpy.ndarray, using a for-loop. The two arrays must have the same dimensions.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector.
      y: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector.
    Returns:
      The dot product of the two vectors as a float.
      None if x or y are empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if x and y does not share the same dimensions.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```

## Examples:

```python
import numpy as np
X = np.array([0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21])
Y = np.array([2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19])

dot(X, Y)
# 917.0

np.dot(X, Y)
# 917

dot(X, X)
# 949.0

np.dot(X, X)
# 949

dot(Y, Y)
# 915.0

np.dot(Y, Y)
# 915
```
