## Objectives:

You must implement the following formula as a function:  
$$
\sum_{i = 1}^{n} f(x_i)
$$

where: 
- $x_i$ is the ith component of the vector $x$
- $f$ is a function applied to $x_i$. In other words $f$ is a function applied element-wise to the vector $x$.


## Instructions:

In the sum.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def sum_(x, f):
    """Computes the sum of a non-empty numpy.ndarray onto wich a function is
applied element-wise, using a for-loop.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector.
      f: has to be a function, a function to apply element-wise to the vector.
    Returns:
      The sum as a float.
      None if x is an empty numpy.ndarray or if f is not a valid function.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```


## Examples

```python
import numpy as np
X = np.array([0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21])

sum_(X, lambda x: x)
# 7.0
sum_(X, lambda x: x**2)
# 949.0
```
