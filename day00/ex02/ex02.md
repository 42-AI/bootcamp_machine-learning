## Objectives:

You must implement the following formula as a function:  
$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i = 1}^{m} (x_i - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j = 1}^{m} x_j)^{2} 
$$

Where: 
- $\sigma^2$ is the mathematical notation of the variance, which is a real number
- $x$ is a vector of dimension m * 1
- $x_i$ is the ith component of the vector $x$
- $x_j$ is the jth component of the vector $x$
- $m$ is the number of components in $x$

Do not worry! You have already encounter half of this ugly gang of summation signs.
And they are not as tough as they try to look like... 

$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i = 1}^{m} (x_i - \mu)^{2}
$$


## Instructions:

In the variance.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def variance(x):
    """Computes the variance of a non-empty numpy.ndarray, using a for-loop.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector.
    Returns:
      The variance as a float.
      None if x is an empty numpy.ndarray.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```

## Examples

```python
import numpy as np
X = np.array([0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21])

variance(X)
# 134.57142857142858

np.var(X)
# 134.57142857142858

variance(X/2)
# 33.642857142857146

np.var(X/2)
# 33.642857142857146
```
