**Objective:**
You must implement the following formula as a function:  
$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{m - 1} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i)^{2} 
$$

where: 
- $\sigma^2$ is the mathematical notation of the variance, which is a real number
- $x$ is a vector
- $x_i$ is the ith value of the vector $x$
- $m$ is the number of elements in $x$

Do not worry! You have already encounter half of this ugly gang of summation signs.
And they are not as tough as they try to look like... 

$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{m - 1} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^{2}
$$


**Instructions:**
In the variance.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def varaiance(x):
    """Computes the variance of a non-empty numpy.ndarray, using a for-loop.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector.
    Returns:
      The variance as a float.
      None if x is a non-empty numpy.ndarray or if f is not a valid function.
    Raises:
      This function shouldn't raise any Exception.
    """
```

**Examples**
```python
>>> X = numpy.array([0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21])
>>> variance(X)
134.57142857142858
>>> numpy.var(X)
134.57142857142858
>>>
>>> variance(X/2)
33.642857142857146
>>> numpy.var(X/2)
33.642857142857146
```
