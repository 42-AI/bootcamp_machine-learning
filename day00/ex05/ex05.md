## Objectives:

You must implement the following formula as a function:  
  
$$
(xy)_i =  x_i \cdot y \text{ for i = 0, 1, ..., m}
$$

Where:  
- $x$ is a matrix of dimensions (m, n),
- $y$ is a vector of dimension (n, 1),
- $x_i$ is the ith component of the matrix $x$ which is a row vector.


## Instructions:

In the mat_vec_prod.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def mat_vec_prod(x, y):
    """Computes the product of two non-empty numpy.ndarray, using a for-loop. The two arrays must have compatible dimensions.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimension (m, n).
      y: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (n, 1).
    Returns:
      The product of the matrix and the vector as a vector of dimension (m, 1).
      None if x or y are empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if x and y does not share compatibles dimensions.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```


## Examples:

```python
import numpy as np
W = np.array([
	[ -8,   8,  -6,  14,  14,  -9,  -4],
	[  2, -11,  -2, -11,  14,  -2,  14],
	[-13,  -2,  -5,   3,  -8,  -4,  13],
	[  2,  13, -14, -15, -14, -15,  13],
	[  2,  -1,  12,   3,  -7,  -3,  -6]])
X = np.array([0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21]).reshape((7,1))
Y = np.array([2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19]).reshape((7,1))

mat_vec_prod(W, X)
# array([[ 497],
       [-356],
       [-345],
       [-270],
       [ -69]])

W.dot(X)
# array([[ 497],
       [-356],
       [-345],
       [-270],
       [ -69]])

#mat_vec_prod(W, Y)
# array([[ 452],
       [-285],
       [-333],
       [-182],
       [-133]])

W.dot(Y)
# array([[ 452],
       [-285],
       [-333],
       [-182],
       [-133]])
```
