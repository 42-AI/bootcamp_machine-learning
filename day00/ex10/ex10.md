## Objectives:

You must implement the following formula as a function:  

$$
MSE = \frac{1}{m}(X\theta - y)^{T}(X\theta - y)
$$

Where:
- $x$ is a matrix of dimension (m, n),
- $\theta$ is a vector of dimension (n, 1),
- $y$ is a vector of dimension (m, 1),


## Instructions:

In the vec_linear_mse.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def vec_linear_mse(x, y, theta):
    """Computes the mean squared error of three non-empty numpy.ndarray, without any for-loop. The three arrays must have compatible dimensions.
    Args:
      y: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (m, 1).
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimesion (m, n).
      theta: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (n, 1).
    Returns:
      The mean squared error as a float.
      None if y, x, or theta are empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if y, x or theta does not share compatibles dimensions.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```

## Examples:

```python
import numpy as np
X = np.array([
	[ -6,  -7,  -9],
        [ 13,  -2,  14],
        [ -7,  14,  -1],
        [ -8,  -4,   6],
        [ -5,  -9,   6],
        [  1,  -5,  11],
        [  9, -11,   8]])
Y = np.array([2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19])
Z = np.array([3, 0.5, -6])

vec_linear_mse(X, Y, Z)
# 2641.0

W = np.array([0, 0, 0])

vec_linear_mse(X, Y, W)
# 130.71428571
```
