## Question time!

Are you able to clearly and simply explain:

1 - Why we are concatenating a column of ones with the $x$ vector when we use the linear algebra trick?   

2 - Why the cost function squares the distance between the data points and their predicted value?

3 - What the cost function's output represents?

4 - Toward which value we would like the cost function to tend to ? What would it mean?
