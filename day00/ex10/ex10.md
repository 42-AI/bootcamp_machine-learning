# Exercise 10 -  Question time!

## Are you able to clearly and simply explain:

1 - Why do we concatenate a column of ones to the left of the $x$ vector when we use the linear algebra trick?   

2 - Why does the cost function square the distances between the data points and their predicted values?

3 - What does the cost function's output represent?

4 - Toward which value do we want the cost function to tend? What would that mean? 

5 - Do you understand why are matrix multiplications are not commutative?
