You certainly had a lot of fun implementing your cost function. Remember we told you it was **one among many possible ways of measuring the cost**. Now, you will get to implement other metrics.  You already know about one of them: **MSE**. There are several more which are quite common: **RMSE**, **MAE** and **R2score**.  

## Objective:
You must implement the following formulas as functions:

$$
MSE(y, \hat{y}) = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)})^2
$$

$$
RMSE(y, \hat{y}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)})^2}
$$

$$
MAE(y, \hat{y}) = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}|{\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)}}|
$$

$$
R^2(y, \hat{y}) = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\hat{y}^{(i)} - \bar{y})^2}
$$

Where:
- $y$ is a vector of dimension m * 1,
- $\hat{y}$ is a vector of dimension m * 1,
- $y^{(i)}$ is the ith component of vector $y$,
- $\hat{y}^{(i)}$ is the ith component of $\hat{y}$,
- $\bar{y}$ is the mean of the vector $y$

## Instructions:
In the other_costs.py file create the following functions: RMSE, MAE, R2score, as per the instructions given below:
```python
def mse_(y, y_hat):
	"""
	Description:
		Calculate the MSE between the predicted output and the real output.
	Args:
        y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
        y_hat: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.		
	Returns:
		mse: has to be a float.
		None if there is a matching dimension problem.
	Raises:
		This function should not raise any Exceptions.
	"""
		... your code here ...

def rmse_(y, y_hat):
	"""
	Description:
		Calculate the RMSE between the predicted output and the real output.
	Args:
	        y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
        y_hat: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.		
	Returns:
		rmse: has to be a float.
		None if there is a matching dimension problem.
	Raises:
		This function should not raise any Exceptions.
	"""
		... your code here ...

def mae_(y, y_hat):
	"""
	Description:
		Calculate the MAE between the predicted output and the real output.
	Args:
        y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
        y_hat: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.		
	Returns:
		mae: has to be a float.
		None if there is a matching dimension problem.
	Raises:
		This function should not raise any Exceptions.
	"""
		... your code here ...
    
def r2score_(y, y_hat):
	"""
	Description:
		Calculate the R2score between the predicted output and the output.
	Args:
        y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
        y_hat: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.		
	Returns:
		r2score: has to be a float.
		None if there is a matching dimension problem.
	Raises:
		This function should not raise any Exceptions.
	"""
		... your code here ...
```
## Remarks:
You might consider to code four more methods **mse_elem()**, **rmse_elem_()**, **mae_elem()** and **r2score_elem()** similar to what you did for the cost function in the exercise 07.


## Examples
```python
import numpy as np
x = np.array([0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21])
y = np.array([2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19])

# Example 1:
mse_(x,y)
# Output:
4.285714285714286

# Example 2:
rmse_(x,y)
# Output:
2.0701966780270626

# Example 3:
mae(x,y)
# Output:
1.7142857142857142

# Example 4:
r2score_(x,y)
# Output:
0.9681721733858745
```
