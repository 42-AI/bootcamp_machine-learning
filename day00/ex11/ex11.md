## Objectives:

You must implement the following formula as a function:  

$$
\nabla(J)_j = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_{\theta}(x_i) - y_i)x_{i}^{(j)} \text{ for j = 1, ..., n}
$$

Where:  
- $\nabla(J)$ is a vector of dimension (n, 1), (this strange symbol : $\nabla$ is called nabla),
- $x$ is a matrix of dimension (m, n) (i.e. a matrix containing m vectors of dimension (1,n)),
- $y$ is a vector of dimension (m, 1),
- $\theta$ is a vector of dimension (n, 1),
- $x_i$ is the ith component of vector $x$,
- $y_i$ is the ith component of vector $y$,
- $\nabla(J)_j$ is the jth component of $\nabla(J)$,
- $h_{\theta}(x_i)$ is the result of the dot product of the vector $\theta$ and the vector $x_i$.


## Instructions:

In the gradient.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def gradient(x, y, theta):
    """Computes a gradient vector from three non-empty numpy.ndarray, using a for-loop. The two arrays must have the compatible dimensions.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a matrice of dimension (m, n).
      y: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (m, 1).
      theta: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector (n, 1).
    Returns:
      The gradient as a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimensions (n, 1).
      None if x, y, or theta are empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if x, y and theta do not have compatible dimensions.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```


## Examples:

```python
import numpy as np
X = np.array([
	[ -6,  -7,  -9],
        [ 13,  -2,  14],
        [ -7,  14,  -1],
        [ -8,  -4,   6],
        [ -5,  -9,   6],
        [  1,  -5,  11],
        [  9, -11,   8]])
Y = np.array([2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19])
Z = np.array([3, 0.5, -6])

gradient(X, Y, Z)
# array([ -37.35714286, 183.14285714, -393.])

W = np.array([0, 0, 0])
gradient(X, Y, W)
# array([  0.85714286,  23.28571429, -26.42857143])

gradient(X, X.dot(Z), Z)
# array([0., 0., 0.])
```
