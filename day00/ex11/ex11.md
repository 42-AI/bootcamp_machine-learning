You certainly had a lot of fun implementing your cost function. Remember we told you it was **one among many possible ways of measuring the cost**. Now, you will get to implement other metrics.  You already know about one of them: **MSE**.  
There are several more which are quite common: **RMSE**, **MAE** and **R2score**.  

## Objective:
You must implement the following formulas as functions:

$$
MSE(y, \hat{y}) = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)})^2
$$

$$
RMSE(y, \hat{y}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)})^2}
$$

$$
MAE(y, \hat{y}) = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}|{\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)}}|
$$

$$
R^2(y, \hat{y}) = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{m}({y}^{(i)} - \bar{y})^2}
$$

Where:
- $y$ is a vector of dimension $m * 1$,
- $\hat{y}$ is a vector of dimension $m * 1$,
- $y^{(i)}$ is the $i^{th}$ component of vector $y$,
- $\hat{y}^{(i)}$ is the $i^{th}$ component of $\hat{y}$,
- $\bar{y}$ is the mean of the $y$ vector

## Instructions:
In the `other_costs.py` file, create the following functions: MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2score, as per the instructions given below:
```python
def mse_(y, y_hat):
	"""
	Description:
		Calculate the MSE between the predicted output and the real output.
	Args:
        y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
        y_hat: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.		
	Returns:
		mse: has to be a float.
		None if there is a matching dimension problem.
	Raises:
		This function should not raise any Exceptions.
	"""
		... your code here ...

def rmse_(y, y_hat):
	"""
	Description:
		Calculate the RMSE between the predicted output and the real output.
	Args:
	        y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
        y_hat: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.		
	Returns:
		rmse: has to be a float.
		None if there is a matching dimension problem.
	Raises:
		This function should not raise any Exceptions.
	"""
		... your code here ...

def mae_(y, y_hat):
	"""
	Description:
		Calculate the MAE between the predicted output and the real output.
	Args:
        y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
        y_hat: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.		
	Returns:
		mae: has to be a float.
		None if there is a matching dimension problem.
	Raises:
		This function should not raise any Exceptions.
	"""
		... your code here ...

def r2score_(y, y_hat):
	"""
	Description:
		Calculate the R2score between the predicted output and the output.
	Args:
        y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
        y_hat: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.		
	Returns:
		r2score: has to be a float.
		None if there is a matching dimension problem.
	Raises:
		This function should not raise any Exceptions.
	"""
		... your code here ...
```
## Remarks:
You might consider implementing four more methods, similar to what you did for the cost function in exercise 07:
-  `mse_elem()`
-  `rmse_elem_()`
-  `mae_elem()`
-  `r2score_elem()` .


## Examples
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error, r2_score
from math import sqrt

# Example 1:
x = np.array([0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21])
y = np.array([2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19])

# Mean squared error
## your implementation
mse_(x,y)
## Output:
4.285714285714286
## sklearn implementation
mean_squared_error(x,y)
## Output:
4.285714285714286

# Root mean squared error
## your implementation
rmse_(x,y)
## Output:
2.0701966780270626
## sklearn implementation not available: take the square root of MSE
sqrt(mean_squared_error(x,y))
## Output:
2.0701966780270626

# Mean absolute error
## your implementation
mae_(x,y)
# Output:
1.7142857142857142
## sklearn implementation
mean_absolute_error(x,y)
# Output:
1.7142857142857142

# R2-score
## your implementation
r2score_(x,y)
## Output:
0.9681721733858745
## sklearn implementation
r2_score(x,y)
## Output:
0.9681721733858745
```
