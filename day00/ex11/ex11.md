Now, you have to implement other metrics. You already know about one of them: MSE. There are several more which are quite usual: RMSE, MAE and R2score.  

**Objective:**
You must implement the following formulas as functions:

$$
MSE(\hat{y}, y) = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2
$$

$$
RMSE(\hat{y}, y) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2}
$$

$$
MAE(\hat{y}, y) = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\abs{\hat{y}_i - y_i}
$$

$$
R2Score(\hat{y}, y) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\hat{y}_i - \bar{y})^2}
$$

Where:
- $y$ is a vector of dimension m * 1,
- $\hat{y}$ is a vector of dimension m * 1,
- $\hat{y}_i$ is the ith component of $\hat{y}$,
- $y_i$ is the ith component of vector $y$,
- $\bar{y}$ is the mean of the vector $y$

**Instructions:**
In the other_costs.py file create the following functions: RMSE, MAE, R2score, as per the instructions given below:
```python
def mse_(x, y, theta):
	"""
	Description:
		Calculate the MSE between the predicted output and the real output.
	Args:
		x: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimension m * n: (number of training examples, number of features).
        y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1: (number of training examples, 1).
		theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (n + 1) * 1: (number of features + 1, 1).
	Returns:
		mse: has to be a float.
		None if there is a matching dimension problem.
	Raises:
		This function should not raise any Exception.
	"""
		... your code here ...

def rmse_(x, y, theta):
	"""
	Description:
		Calculate the RMSE between the predicted output and the real output.
	Args:
		x: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimension m * n: (number of training examples, number of features).
        y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1: (number of training examples, 1).
		theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (n + 1) * 1: (number of features + 1, 1).
	Returns:
		rmse: has to be a float.
		None if there is a matching dimension problem.
	Raises:
		This function should not raise any Exception.
	"""
		... your code here ...

def mae_(x, y, theta):
	"""
	Description:
		Calculate the MAE between the predicted output and the real output.
	Args:
		x: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimension m * n: (number of training examples, number of features).
        y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1: (number of training examples, 1).
		theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (n + 1) * 1: (number of features + 1, 1).
	Returns:
		mae: has to be a float.
		None if there is a matching dimension problem.
	Raises:
		This function should not raise any Exception.
	"""
		... your code here ...
    
def r2score_(x, y, theta):
	"""
	Description:
		Calculate the R2score between the predicted output and the output.
	Args:
		x: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimension m * n: (number of training examples, number of features).
        y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1: (number of training examples, 1).
		theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (n + 1) * 1: (number of features + 1, 1).
	Returns:
		r2score: has to be a float.
		None if there is a matching dimension problem.
	Raises:
		This function should not raise any Exception.
	"""
		... your code here ...
```
**Remarks:**
You might consider to code three more methods **mse_elem()**, **rmse_elem_()**, **mae_elem()** and **r2score_()** similar to what you did for the cost function in the exercise 07.



**Examples**
```python
import numpy as np
X = np.array([0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21])
Y = np.array([2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19])

# Example 1:
cost(X, Y)
# Output:
4.285714285714286

# Example 2:
cost(X, X)
# Output:
0.0
```
