You must implement the following formula as a function:  
$$
\lamda \theta^T \theta
$$

Where 
- $\theta$ is a vector of length n,
- $\lambda$ is a constant

Create a function called `vec_ridge` which takes two arguments: 
- an array which correspond to the vector $\theta$ in the previous formula
- a double which correspond to $\lambda$ in the previous formula

The function return a double, using a vectorized implementation.

```python
>>> X = [0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21]
>>> vec_ridge(X, 0.5)
474.5
```
