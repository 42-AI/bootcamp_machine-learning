You must implement the following formula as a function:  
$$
\frac{1}{2m}(X\theta - y)^{T} (X\theta - y) + \lambda\theta^{T}\theta
$$

where  
- x is a matrix of size m * n (i.e. a matrix containing m vectors of size n)
- y is a vector of size m 
- $\theta$ is a vector of length n,
- \lambda is a constant

Create a function called `vec_reg_mse` which takes four arguments : 
  - an array which correspond to the matrix X in the previous formula,
  - an array which correspond to the vector y in the previous formula,
  - an array which correspond to the vector $\theta$ in the previous formula,
  - a double corresponding to $\lambda$

Your function must use a for loop and returns a double.

```python
>>> X = np.arange(21).reshape((7,3))
>>> X
array([[ 0,  1,  2],
       [ 3,  4,  5],
       [ 6,  7,  8],
       [ 9, 10, 11],
       [12, 13, 14],
       [15, 16, 17],
       [18, 19, 20]])
>>> Y = [2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19]
>>> th = np.ones(3) * 0.5
>>> vec_reg_mse(X, Y, th, 0.1)
244.93214285714288
>>> vec_reg_mse(X, Y, th * 2, 0.05)
730.5071428571429
```
