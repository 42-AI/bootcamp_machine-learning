You must implement the following formula as a function:    
$$
\nabla(J) = \frac{1}{m} X^T(X\theta - y)
$$  

where  
- \nabla(J) is a vector of size n 
- X is a matrix of size m * n (i.e. a matrix containing m vectors of size n)
- y is a vector of size m
- \theta is a vector of size n 

Create a function called `vec_gradient` which takes four arguments : 
  - an array which correspond to the vector x in the previous formula,
  - an array which correspond to the vector y in the previous formula,
  - an array which correspond to the vector \theta 
  
Your function must return a vector containg the result of the formula for all j.

```python
>>> X = [0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21]
>>> Y = [2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19]
>>> h = lambda x : x * 0.8
>>> vec_gradient(X, Y, h, 1)
-11.271428571428569
>>> vec_gradient(X, Y, h, 0.1)
-1.127142857142857
>>> _vecgradient(X, X, lambda x: x, 0.5)
0.0
```
