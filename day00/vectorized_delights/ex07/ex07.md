You must implement the following formula as a function:  
  
![image info](../assets/MSE.png)

$$\frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_{\theta}(x_i) - y_i)^2$$

where  
- x is a matrix of size m * n (i.e. a matrix containing m vectors of size n)
- y is a vector of size m 
- ![image info](../assets/theta.png) // $$\theta$$ is a vector of length n,
- i is the training example's index
- j is the feature's index
- x_i is the ith vector of x
- y_i is the ith elements of y
- ![image info](../assets/hth.png) // $$ h_{\theta}(x_i) $$ is the result of the dot product of the vector \theta and the vector x_i

Create a function called `mse` which takes three arguments : 
  - an array which correspond to the vector x in the previous formula,
  - an array which correspond to the vector y in the previous formula,
  - an array which correspond to the vector \theta in the previous formula,

Your function must use a for loop and returns a double.

```python
>>> X = [0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21]
>>> Y = [2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19]
>>> h = lambda x : x * 0.8
>>> mse(X, Y, h)
3.939999999999999
>>> mse(X, X, h)
2.71142857142857
```
