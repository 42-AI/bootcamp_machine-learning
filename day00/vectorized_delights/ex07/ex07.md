You must implement the following formula as a function:  
$$
\frac_{1}{2m}(X\theta - y)^T (X\theta - y)
$$   
where  
- X is a matrix of size m * n (i.e. a matrix containing m vectors of size n)
- y is a vector of size m 
- $\theta$ is a vector of length n,

Create a function called `vec_mse` which takes three arguments : 
  - an array which correspond to the matrix X in the previous formula,
  - an array which correspond to the vector y in the previous formula,
  - an array which correspond to the vector $\theta$ in the previous formula,

Your function must return a double.

```python
>>> X = [0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21]
>>> Y = [2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19]
>>> theta = []
>>> mse(X, Y, theta)
3.939999999999999
>>> mse(X, X, theta)
2.71142857142857
```
