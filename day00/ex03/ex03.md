## Objectives:

You must implement the following formula as a function:  
$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i = 1}^{m} (x_i - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j = 1}^{m} x_j)^{2}}
$$

Where: 
- $\sigma$ is the mathematical notation of the standard deviation, which is a real number
- $x_i$ is the ith  component of the vector $x$
- $m$ is the number of components in $x$

As before, this formula is not as tough as it seems...  
It can be reduced to something already known.

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i = 1}^{m} (x_i - \mu)^{2}}
$$

Seems familiar?   
...  

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^{2}}
$$


## Instructions:

In the std.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def std(x):
    """Computes the standard deviation of a non-empty numpy.ndarray, using a for-loop.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector.
    Returns:
      The standard deviation as a float.
      None if x is an empty numpy.ndarray.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```


## Examples:

```python
import numpy as np
X = np.array([0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21])

std(X)
# 11.600492600378166

np.std(X)
# 11.600492600378166

Y = np.array([2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19])

std(Y)
# 11.410700312980492

np.std(Y)
# 11.410700312980492
```
