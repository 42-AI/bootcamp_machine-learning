# Day00 - Mathematical Delights

Let's start by recoding some useful functions and formulas that will be used later in the week.  
The idea is to help the students to 'tame' the mathematical jargon. They will have to simply implement the functions following the formulas without knowing what it is about. Then magically this already 'tamed' material will be used in context and understood without having to fight with its abstract notation.

## Notions of the day

Sum, mean, variance, standard deviation, vectors and matrices operations.

## General rules

* The version of Python to use is 3.7, you can check the version of Python with the following command: `python -V`
* The norm: during this bootcamp you will follow the Pep8 standards https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
* The function eval is never allowed.
* The exercises are ordered from the easiest to the hardest.
* Your exercises are going to be evaluated by someone else, so make sure that your variable names and function names are appropriate and civil. 
* Your manual is the internet.
* You can also ask questions in the dedicated channel in the 42 AI Slack: 42-ai.slack.com.
* If you find any issue or mistakes in the subject please create an issue on our dedicated repository on Github:  https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_machine-learning/issues.

## Helper

Ensure that you have the right Python version.

```
> which python
/goinfre/miniconda/bin/python
> python -V
Python 3.7.*
> which pip
/goinfre/miniconda/bin/pip
```
