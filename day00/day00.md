# Day00 - Step into Machine Learning

You will start by reviewing some linear algebra and statistics. Then you will implement your first model and learn how to evaluate its performances. 

## Notions of the day
Sum, mean, variance, standard deviation, vectors and matrices operations.  
Hypothesis, model, regression, cost function.

## General rules

* The version of Python to use is 3.7, you can check the version of Python with the following command: `python -V`
* The norm: during this bootcamp you will follow the Pep8 standards https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
* The function eval is never allowed.
* The exercises are ordered from the easiest to the hardest.
* Your exercises are going to be evaluated by someone else, so make sure that your variable names and function names are appropriate and civil. 
* Your manual is the internet.
* You can also ask questions in the dedicated channel in the 42 AI Slack: 42-ai.slack.com.
* If you find any issue or mistakes in the subject please create an issue on our dedicated repository on Github:  https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_machine-learning/issues.

## Helper

Ensure that you have the right Python version.

```
> which python
/goinfre/miniconda/bin/python
> python -V
Python 3.7.*
> which pip
/goinfre/miniconda/bin/pip
```
