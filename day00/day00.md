# Day00 - Mathematical Delights

A brief description of the day goes here.

## Notions of the day

Notion 1, Notion 2, ...

## General rules

* The version of Python to use is 3.7, you can check the version of Python with the following command: `python -V`
* The norm: during this bootcamp you will follow the Pep8 standards https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
* The function eval is never allowed.
* The exercices are ordered from the easiest to the hardest.
* Your exercices are going to be evaluated by someone else so make sure that variables and functions names are appropriated.
* Your man is internet.
* You can also ask question in the dedicated channel in Slack: 42-ai.slack.com.
* If you find any issue or mistakes in the subject please create an issue on our dedicated repository on Github: https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_python/issues.
