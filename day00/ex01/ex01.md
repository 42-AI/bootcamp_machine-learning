## Objectives:

You must implement the following formula as a function:  
$$
\mu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i = 1}^{m} x_i
$$

Where: 
- $\mu$ is the mathematical notation of the mean, which is a real number
- $x_i$ is the ith component of the vector $x$
- $m$ is the number of elements of $x$


## Instructions:

In the mean.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def mean(x):
    """Computes the mean of a non-empty numpy.ndarray, using a for-loop.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector.
    Returns:
      The mean as a float.
      None if x is an empty numpy.ndarray.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```

## Examples

```python
import numpy as np
X = np.array([0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21])

mean(X)
# 1.0

X = np.array([0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21])

mean(X ** 2)
# 135.57142857142858
```
