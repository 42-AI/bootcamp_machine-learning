|   Files to turn in :    |  mean.py           |

**Objective:**
You must implement the following formula as a function:  
$$
\mu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i = 1}^{m} f(x_i)
$$

where: 
- $mu$ is the mathematical notation of the mean, which is a real number
- $x_i$ is the ith component of the vector $x$
- $m$ is the number of elements of $x$

**Instructions:**
In the sum.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def mean(x):
    """Computes the mean of a non-empty numpy.ndarray, using a for-loop.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector.
    Returns:
      The mean as a float.
      None if x is an empty numpy.ndarray or if f is not a valid function.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```

**Examples**
```python
>>> X = numpy.array([0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21])
>>> mean(X)
1.0
>>> X = numpy.array([0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21])
>>> mean(X ** 2)
135.57142857142858
```
