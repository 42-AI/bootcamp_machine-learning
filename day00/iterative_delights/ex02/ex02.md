You must implement the following formula as a function:

If you look carefully you will discover that this messy formula can be expressed as terms you have previously implemented.

Create a function called `variance` which takes an array as argument and returns its variance, using a foor loop.

```python
>>> X = [0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21]
>>> variance(X)
134.57142857142858
```
