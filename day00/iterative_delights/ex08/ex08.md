You must implement the following formula as a function:  
  
![image info](../assets/ridge.png)

Where ![image info](../assets/theta.png) is a vector of length n.

Create a function called `ridge` which takes an array and a double as argument and returns the sum of all of its elements squared times lambda, using a foor loop.

```python
>>> X = [0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21]
>>> ridge(X, 0.5)
474.5
```
