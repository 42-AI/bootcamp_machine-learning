**Objective:**
You must implement the following formula as a function:  

$$
\nabla(J)_j = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_{\theta}(x_i) - y_i)x_{i}^{(j)}
$$

where  
- $\nabla(J)$ is a vector of size n 
- $x$ is a matrix of size m * n (i.e. a matrix containing m vectors of size n)
- $y$ is a vector of dimension m * 1
- $\theta$ is a vector of dimension n * 1
- $x_i$ is the ith vector of x
- $y_i$ is the ith elements of y
- $\nabla(J)_j$ is the jth element of $\nabla(J)$
- $h_{\theta}(x_i)$ is the result of the dot product of the vector $\theta$ and the vector $x_i$

**Instructions:**
In the gradient.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def gradient(x, y, theta):
    """Computes a gradient vector from three non-empty numpy.ndarray, using a for-loop. The two arrays must have the compatible dimensions.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a matrice of dimension m * n.
      y: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      theta: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector n * 1.
    Returns:
      The gradient as a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimensions n * 1.
      None if x, y, or theta are not non-empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if x, y and theta do not have compatible dimensions.
    Raises:
      This function shouldn't raise any Exception.
    """
```

**Examples** 
```python
>>> X = [0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21]
>>> Y = [2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19]
>>> gradient(X, Y, h, 1)
-11.271428571428569
>>> gradient(X, Y, h, 0.1)
-1.127142857142857
>>> gradient(X, X, lambda x: x, 0.5)
0.0
```
