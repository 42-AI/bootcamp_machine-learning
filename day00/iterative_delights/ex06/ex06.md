Create a function called `mse` which takes three arguments : 
  - an array which correspond to the vector x in the previous formula,
  - an array which correspond to the vector y in the previous formula,
  - a function to be applied element-wise to the vector X, corresponding to the 

Your function must returns a double.

```python
>>> X = [0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21]
>>> sum(X)
7
```
