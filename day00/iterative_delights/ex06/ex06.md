You must implement the following formula as a function:  
  
$$
\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i y_i
$$

where:  
- x is a vector of lenght n
- y is a vector of length n
- x_i is the ith value of the vector x
- y_i is the ith value of the vector y

Create a function called `dot` which takes two arguments: 
  - an array corresponding to the vector x,
  - an array corresponding to the vector y,

The function must return the dot product of the two vectors (i.e. the sum of the element-wise multiplication of the vectors x and y) as a double.
The function must use a foor loop.

```python
>>> X = [0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21]
>>> Y = [2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19]
>>> dot(X, Y)
917
>>> dot(X, X)
949
```
