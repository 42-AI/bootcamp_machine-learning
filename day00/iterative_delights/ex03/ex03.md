You must implement the following formula as a function:

As before, this formula is not as tough as it seems...  
It can be reduced to something already known.

Seems familiar?

Create a function called `std` which takes an array as argument and returns its standard deviation, using a foor loop.

```python
>>> X = [0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21]
>>> std(X)
11.600492600378166
```
