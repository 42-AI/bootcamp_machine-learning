You must implement the following formula as a function:

If you look carefully you will discover that this messy formula can be expressed as terms you have previously implemented.

Create a function called `std` which takes an array as argument and returns its standard deviation, using a foor loop.

```python
>>> X = [0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21]
>>> std(X)
11.600492600378166
```
