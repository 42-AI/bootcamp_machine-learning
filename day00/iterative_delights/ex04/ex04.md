**Objective:**
You must implement the following formula as a function:  
$$
x_{i}' = \frac{x_i - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i = 1}^{m} x_i}{\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{m - 1} \sum_{i = 1}^{m} (x_i - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i = 1}^{m} x_i)^{2}}}
$$

where: 
- $x$ is a vector
- $x_i$ is the ith value of the vector $x$
- $m$ is the number of elements in $x$

Which is way easier to understand in the following form:

$$
x_{i}' = \frac{x_i - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

**Instructions:**
In the zscore.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def zscore(x):
    """Computes the z-score standardization lambda function of a non-empty numpy.ndarray, using a for-loop.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector.
    Returns:
      The z-score standardisation lambda function, which takes a number as input and returns the normalized value of this number for the vector x.
      None if x is a non-empty numpy.ndarray.
    Raises:
      This function shouldn't raise any Exception.
    """
```

**Examples**
```python
>>> X = numpy.array([0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21])
>>> z_x = zscore(X)
>>> z_x(15)
1.2068453023747985
>>> z_x(-21)
-1.896471189446112
>>> z_x(0)
-0.08620323588391418
>>>
>>> Y = np.array([2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19])
>>> z_y = zscore(Y)
>>> z_y(15)
1.2519577145903358
>>> z_y(-21)
-1.9029757261773106
>>> z_y(0)
-0.06259788572951679
```
