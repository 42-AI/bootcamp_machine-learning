You must implement the following formula as a function:

Which is way easier in the following form:

Create a function called `zscore` which takes an array as argument and returns a lambda function of the z-score standardization for that array.

```python
>>> X = [0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21]
>>> z = zscore(X)
>>> z(15)
1.2068453023747985
>>> z(-21)
-1.896471189446112
>>> z(0)
-0.08620323588391418
```
