**Objective:**
You must implement the following formula as a function:  

$$
MSE = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2
$$

where:
- $y$ is a vector of dimension m,
- $\hat{y}$ is a vector of dimension m,
- $\hat{y}_i$ is the ith vector of $\hat{y}$,
- $y_i$ is the ith elements of $y$,

**Instructions:**
In the mse.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def mse(y, y_hat):
    """Computes the mean squared error of two non-empty numpy.ndarray, using a for-loop. The two arrays must have the same dimensions.
    Args:
      y: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector.
      y_hat: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector.
    Returns:
      The mean squared error of the two vectors as a float.
      None if y or y_hat are non-empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if y and y_hat does not share the same dimensions.
    Raises:
      This function shouldn't raise any Exception.
    """
```

**Examples**
```python
>>> X = np.array([0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21])
>>> Y = np.array([2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19])
>>> mse(X, Y)
4.285714285714286
>>> mse(X, X)
0.0
```
