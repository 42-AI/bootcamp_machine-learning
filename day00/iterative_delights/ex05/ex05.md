**Objective:**
You must implement the following formula as a function:  
  
$$
(xy^{T})_i =  x_i \cdot y \text{ for i = 0, 1, ..., m}
$$

where:  
- $x$ is a matrix of dimensions m * n
- $y$ is a vector of dimension n * 1
- $x_i$ is the ith vector of the matrix  $x$

**Instructions:**
In the dot.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def mat_vec_mult(x, y):
    """Computes the product of two non-empty numpy.ndarray, using a for-loop. The two arrays must have compatible dimensions.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimension m * n.
      y: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension n * 1.
    Returns:
      The product of the matrix and the vector as a vector.
      None if x or y are non-empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if x and y does not share compatibles dimensions.
    Raises:
      This function shouldn't raise any Exception.
    """
```

**Examples**
```python
>>> X = numpy.array([0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21])
>>> Y = numpy.array([2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19])
>>> dot(X, Y)
917
>>> np.dot(X, Y)
917
>>>
>>> dot(X, X)
949
>>> np.dot(X, X)
949
>>>
>>> dot(Y, Y)
915
>>> np.dot(Y, Y)
915
```
