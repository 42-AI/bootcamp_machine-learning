You must implement the following formula as a function:  
$$\nabla(J)_0 = \frac{\alpha}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_{\theta}(x_i) - y_i)x_{i}^{(j)}$$  
$$\nabla(J)_j = \frac{\alpha}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_{\theta}(x_i) - y_i)x_{i}^{(j)} + \lambda \theta_j$$

where  
- \nabla(J) is a vector of size n   
- x is a matrix of size m * n (i.e. a matrix containing m vectors of size n)  
- y is a vector of size m  
- \theta is a vector of size n   
- i is the training example's index
- j is the feature's index 
- x_i is the ith vector of x
- y_i is the ith elements of y
- \nabla(J)_j is the jth element of \nabla(J)
- ![image info](../assets/hth.png) // $$ h_{\theta}(x_i) $$ is the result of the dot product of the vector \theta and the vector x_i
- alpha is a constant

Create a function called `gradient` which takes four arguments : 
  - an array which correspond to the vector x in the previous formula,
  - an array which correspond to the vector y in the previous formula,
  - an array which correspond to the vector \theta which is used to compute $$ h_{\theta}(x_i) $$ // ![image info](../assets/hth.png),
  - a double corresponding to ![image info](../assets/alpha.png)
  
Your function must use a for loop and returns a vector containg the result of the formula for all j.

```python
>>> X = np.arange(21).reshape((7,3))
>>> X
array([[ 0,  1,  2],
       [ 3,  4,  5],
       [ 6,  7,  8],
       [ 9, 10, 11],
       [12, 13, 14],
       [15, 16, 17],
       [18, 19, 20]])
>>> Y = [2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19]
>>> th = np.ones(3) * 0.5
>>> reg_grad(X, Y, th, 0.1)
array([207.42857143, 221.72142857, 236.00714286])
>>> reg_grad(X, Y, th * 2, 0.05)
array([396.42857143, 425.72142857, 455.00714286])
```
