You must implement the following formula as a function:

$$
\sum_{i = 1}^{n} f(x_i)
$$

where:  
- x is a vector
- x_i is the ith value of the vector x
- f is a function applied to x_i, in other words f is a function applied element-wise to the vector x.

Create a function called `sum_` which takes two arguments: 
  - an array corresponding to the vector X,
  - a function corresponding to f().

The function must return the sum of the elements to which the function f is applied as a double.
The function must use a foor loop.

```python
>>> X = [0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21]
>>> sum_(X, lambda x: x)
7
>>> X = [0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21]
>>> sum_(X, lambda x: x**2)
949
```
