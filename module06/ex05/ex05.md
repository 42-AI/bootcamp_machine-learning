## Objectives:
* Be able to explain what it means to __*fit*__ a Machine Learning model to a dataset
* Implement a function that performs **Linear Gradient Descent** (LGD).


## Instructions:
In this exercise, you will implement linear gradient descent to fit your model to the dataset.

The pseudocode for the algorithm is the following:

$$
\begin{matrix}
&\text{repeat until convergence:} & \{ \\
&	\text{compute } \nabla{(J)}  \\
&	\theta_0 := \theta_0 - \alpha \nabla(J)_0  \\
&	\theta_1 := \theta_1 - \alpha \nabla(J)_1\\
	\}
\end{matrix}
$$

Where:
- $\alpha$ (alpha) is the *learning rate*. It's a small float number (usually between 0 and 1)
- For now, "reapeat until convergence" will mean to simply repeat for n_cycles (a number that you will choose wisely)


You are expected to write a function named `fit_` as per the instructions below:
``` python
def fit_(x, y, theta, alpha, max_iter):
	"""
	Description:
		Fits the model to the training dataset contained in x and y.
	Args:
		x: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1: (number of training examples, 1).
		y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1: (number of training examples, 1).
		theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension 2 * 1.
		alpha: has to be a float, the learning rate
		max_iter: has to be an int, the number of iterations done during the gradient descent
	Returns:
		new_theta: numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension 2 * 1.
		None if there is a matching dimension problem.
	Raises:
		This function should not raise any Exception.
	"""
		... your code here ...
```
Hopefully, you have already written a function to calculate the linear gradient.  

## Examples:
```python
import numpy as np
x = np.array([[12.4956442], [21.5007972], [31.5527382], [48.9145838], [57.5088733]])
y = np.array([[37.4013816], [36.1473236], [45.7655287], [46.6793434], [59.5585554]])
theta= np.array([1, 1])

# Example 0:
theta1 = fit_(x, y, theta, alpha=5e-8, max_iter=1500000)
theta1
# Output:
array([[1.40709365],
       [1.1150909 ]])

# Example 1:
predict(x, theta1)
# Output:
array([[15.3408728 ],
       [25.38243697],
       [36.59126492],
       [55.95130097],
       [65.53471499]])
```

## Remarks:
- You can create more training data by generating an $x$ array with random values and computing the corresponding $y$ vector as a linear expression of $x$. You can then fit a model on this artificial data and find out if it comes out with the same $\theta$ coefficients that first you used.
- It is possible that $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ become "[nan]". In that case, it means you probably used a learning rate that is too large.
