## Objectives:

You must implement the following formula as a function:    

$$
\nabla(J) = \frac{1}{m} {X'}^T(X'\theta - y)
$$  

Where:  
- $\nabla(J)$ is a vector of dimension $2 * 1$
- $X'$ is a **matrix** of dimension $m * 2$ 
- ${X'}^T$ is the traspose of $X'$. Its dimensions are $2 * m$.
- $y$ is a vector of dimension $m * 1$
- $\theta$ is a vector of dimension $2 * 1$ 
  
Be careful: 
- the $x$ you will get as an input is an $m * 1$ vector 
- $\theta$ is a $2 * 1$ vector. You have to transform $x$ to fit the dimension of $\theta$!

## Instructions:
In the gradient.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def gradient(x, y, theta):
    """Computes a gradient vector from three non-empty numpy.ndarray, without any for loop. The three arrays must have compatible dimensions.
    Args:
      x: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimension m * 1.
      y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a 2 * 1 vector.
    Returns:
      The gradient as a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension 2 * 1.
      None if x, y, or theta is an empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if x, y and theta do not have compatible dimensions.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```

## Examples:
```python
import numpy as np
x = np.array([12.4956442, 21.5007972, 31.5527382, 48.9145838, 57.5088733])
y = np.array([37.4013816, 36.1473236, 45.7655287, 46.6793434, 59.5585554])

# Example 0:
theta1 = np.array([2, 0.7])
gradient(x, y, theta1)
# Output:
array([21.0342574, 587.36875564])

# Example 1:
theta2 = np.array([1, -0.4])
gradient(x, y, theta2)
# Output:
array([58.86823748, 2229.72297889])
```
