## Objective:
You must implement the following formula as a function:  

$$
\begin{matrix}
J(\theta) &  = & \frac{1}{2m}(\hat{y} - y) \cdot(\hat{y}- y)
\end{matrix}
$$

Where:
- $\hat{y}$ is a vector of dimension $m * 1$, the vector of predicted values
- $y$ is a vector of dimension $m * 1$, the vector of expected values

## Instructions:
In the cost.py file, create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def cost_(y, y_hat):
    """Computes the half mean squared error of two non-empty numpy.ndarray, without any for loop. The two arrays must have the same dimensions.
    Args:
      y: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector.
      y_hat: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector.
    Returns:
      The half mean squared error of the two vectors as a float.
      None if y or y_hat are empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if y and y_hat does not share the same dimensions.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exceptions.
    """
```

## Examples:
```python
import numpy as np
X = np.array([0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21])
Y = np.array([2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19])

# Example 1:
cost_(X, Y)
# Output:
2.142857142857143

# Example 2:
cost_(X, X)
# Output:
0.0
```
