# Module05 - Stepping Into Machine Learning

You will start by reviewing some linear algebra and statistics. Then you will implement your first model and learn how to evaluate its performances. 

## Notions of the Day
Sum, mean, variance, standard deviation, vectors and matrices operations.  
Hypothesis, model, regression, cost function. 

## Useful Ressources  
  
We strongly advise you to use the following resource:
[Machine Learning MOOC - Stanford](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/1)  
Here are the sections of the MOOC that are relevant for today's exercises: 

### Week 1: 

**Introduction:**

* What is Machine Learning? (Video + Reading)

## General rules

* The Python version to use is 3.7, you can check with the following command: `python -V`
* The norm: during this bootcamp you will follow the [Pep8 standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
* The function `eval` is never allowed.
* The exercises are ordered from the easiest to the hardest.
* Your exercises are going to be evaluated by someone else, so make sure that your variable names and function names are appropriate and civil. 
* Your manual is the internet.
* You can also ask questions in the `#bootcamps` channel in [42AI's Slack workspace](https://42-ai.slack.com).
* If you find any issues or mistakes in this document, please create an issue on our [dedicated Github repository](https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_machine-learning/issues).

## Helper

Ensure that you have the right Python version.

```
> which python
/goinfre/miniconda/bin/python
> python -V
Python 3.7.*
> which pip
/goinfre/miniconda/bin/pip
```
