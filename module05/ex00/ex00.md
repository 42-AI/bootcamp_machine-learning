 **AI Classics:**   
*These exercises are key assignments from the last bootcamp. If you haven't completed them yet, you should finish them first before you continue with today's exercises.*

You will provide a testing file to prove that your class works as expected.  
You will have to create a helpful class, with more options and providing enhanced ease of use for the user.

In this exercise, you have to create a `Vector` class. The goal is to create vectors and be able to perform mathematical operations with them.
- Columns vectors are represented as list of lists of floats.
- Row vectors are represented as lists of floats.

```py
# Column vector of dimensions n * 1
v1 = Vector([[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
v1 * 5
# Output
Vector([[0.0], [5.0], [10.0], [15.0]])

# Row vector of dimensions 1 * n
v1 = Vector([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
v2 = v1 * 5
# Output
Vector([0.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0])
```

It has 2 attributes:  
* `values` : list of lists of floats 
* `shape` : dimensions of the vector  
```py
# Column vector of dimensions n * 1
Vector([[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]]).shape
# Output
(4,1)

Vector([[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]]).values
# Output
[[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]]


# Row vector of dimensions 1 * n
Vector([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]).shape
# Output
(1, 4) 

Vector([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]).values
# Output
[[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]] 
```

You should be able to initialize the object with:
* a list of floats: `Vector([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0])`  
* a list of list of floats: `Vector([[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])`  
* a size: `Vector(3)` -> the vector will have `values = [[0.0], [1.0], [2.0]]`
* a range: `Vector((10,15))` -> the vector will have `values = [[10.0], [11.0], [12.0], [13.0], [14.0]]`

*By default, the vectors are generated as classical column vectors if initialized with a size or range*

You will implement all the following built-in functions (called 'magic methods') for your `Vector` class:

```py
    __add__
    __radd__
    # add : only vectors of same dimensions.
    __sub__
    __rsub__
    # sub : only vectors of same dimensions.
    __truediv__
    __rtruediv__
    # div : only scalars.
    __mul__
    __rmul__
    # mul : only scalars.
    __str__
    __repr__
```

You will also implement: 
* a `.dot()` method which produce a dot product between two vectors of same dimensions.
* a `.T()` method which converts a vector into its transpose
(i.e. a column vector into a row vector, or a row vector into a column vector). 

```py
# Example 1:
v1 = Vector([[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
v1.shape
# Output:
(4,1)

v1.T()
# Output:
Vector([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

v1.T().shape
# Output:
(1,4)

# Example 2:
v2 = Vector([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
v2.shape
# Output:
(1,4)

v2.T()
# Output:
Vector([[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])

v2.T().shape
# Output:
(4,1)
```

## Authorized vector operations are:  

- Addition between two vectors of same dimension (m * 1)

$$
x + y = 
\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m\end{bmatrix} + 
\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m\end{bmatrix} 
= \begin{bmatrix} x_1 + y_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m + y_m \end{bmatrix}
$$  

- Subtraction between two vectors of same dimension (m * 1)

$$
x - y = 
\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m\end{bmatrix} - 
\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m\end{bmatrix} 
= \begin{bmatrix} x_1 - y_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m - y_m \end{bmatrix}
$$  
â€‹
- Multiplication and division between one vector (m * 1) and one scalar.

$$
\alpha x = \alpha \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m\end{bmatrix}  = 
\begin{bmatrix} \alpha x_1 \\ \vdots \\ \alpha x_m \end{bmatrix}
$$  

- Dot product between two vectors of same dimension (m * 1)  

$$
x \cdot y = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m\end{bmatrix} 
\cdot 
\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ \vdots \\ y_m\end{bmatrix} = 
\sum_{i = 1}^{m} x_i \cdot y_i =  x_1 \cdot y_1 + \dots + x_m \cdot y_m 
$$  

Don't forget to handle all types of error properly!
