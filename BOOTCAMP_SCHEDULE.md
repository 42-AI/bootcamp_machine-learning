# Bootcamp Machine Learning

## Day00: Linear Regression
* Linear Cost Function
* Linear Gradient Descent
* Standardization:
	- z score
	- min-max 
* Regularization:
	- Ridge
	- Lasso
	- Elastic-Net

## Day01: Logistic Regression
* Logistic Cost Function
* Logistic Gradient Descent
* Stochastic Gradient Descent
* Model Evaluation:
	- Regression metric
	- Classification metric

## Day02: Decision Tree
* Decision Tree Algo:
* Classification metric:
	- Entropy
	- Gini
* Regression metric:
	- Variance 
* Cross Validation

## Day03: Random Forest
* Bagging 
* Random Forest
* Feature Importance
* Feature engineering 1:
	- polynomial features
	- interactions terms

## Day04: Boosting
* Boosting 1 : AdaBoost
* Boosting 2: Gradient Boosting
* Feature engineering 2:
	- one-hot encoding

## Day05: KNN + Unsupervized Learning
* KNN
* PCA
* Clustering 

## Rush: A big challenge :)
* Option 1 - SANDBOX: Let students apply what they have learned during the six previous days on a fancy dataset
* Option 2 - ONE LAST STEP: Require to study another final notion/algo. E.g. TIME SERIES
* Option 3 - MIXED 2 & 3: No last step is required to work on the dataset BUT the final notion will be required in order to get the best score possible
