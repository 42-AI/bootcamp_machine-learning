This project is a Machine Learning bootcamp created by [42 AI](http://www.42ai.fr).

As notions seen during this bootcamp can be complex, we very strongly advise students to have previously done the following bootcamp :
* [Python](https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_python)

42 Artificial Intelligence is a student organization of the Paris campus of the school 42. Our purpose is to foster discussion, learning, and interest in the field of artificial intelligence, by organizing various activities such as lectures and workshops.

## Curriculum

### Day00 - Mathematical Delights
**Understand useful mathematical functions and formulas**
> Sum, mean, variance, standard deviation, vectors and matrices operations.

### Day01 - Linear Regression
**Get started with the first concepts constituing the field of Machine Learning**
> Matrix operations, gradient descent, cost function, normal equation, MSE, RMSE R-score and learning rate.

### Day02 - Logistic Regression
**Implement a Logistic Regression class using a Gradient Descent algorithm**
> Sigmoid, Log loss, Gradient descent, Logistic regression, Model evaluation, Confusion matrix.

### Day03 - Feature Engineering and Regularization
**Time for some formulas kata. :martial_arts_uniform:**
> More implementation!

### Day04 - Decision Tree :deciduous_tree:
**Be able to use Decision trees algorithms wisely in the future**
> Gini impurity, entropy, information gain. Decision trees.

### Rush - Classification on MNIST handwritten digits database
**Build the best classifier for handwritten digits recognition!**
> Finding out the missing classes, experimenting several ways to deal with missing / aberrant values.
