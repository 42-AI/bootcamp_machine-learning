## Objectives:

You must implement the following formula as a function:  

$$
\nabla(J)_0 = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_{\theta}(x_i) - y_i) \\
\nabla(J)_1 = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_{\theta}(x_i) - y_i)x_{i}
$$

Where:  
- $\nabla(J)$ is a vector of size 2 * 1, (this strange symbol : $\nabla$ is called nabla)
- $x$ is a vector of dimension m * 1
- $y$ is a vector of dimension m * 1
- $\theta$ is a vector of dimension 2 * 1
- $X_i$ is the ith component of matrix $X$
- $y_i$ is the ith component of vector $y$
- $\nabla(J)_j$ is the jth component of $\nabla(J)$
- $h_{\theta}(x_i)$ is our prediction for $y_i$: the result of the dot product of the vector $\theta$ and the vector $x_i$


## Instructions:
In the gradient.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def simple_gradient(x, y, theta):
    """Computes a gradient vector from three non-empty numpy.ndarray, without any for-loop. The three arrays must have the compatible dimensions.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      y: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      theta: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector 2 * 1.
    Returns:
      The gradient as a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimensions 2 * 1.
      None if x, y, or theta are empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if x, y and theta do not have compatible dimensions.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```

## Examples:
```python
import numpy as np
x = np.array([12.4956442, 21.5007972, 31.5527382, 48.9145838, 57.5088733])
y = np.array([37.4013816, 36.1473236, 45.7655287, 46.6793434, 59.5585554])

# Example 0:
theta1 = np.array([2, 0.7])
simple_gradient(x, y, theta1)
# Output:
array([21.0342574, 587.36875564])

# Example 1:
theta2 = np.array([1, -0.4])
simple_gradient(x, y, theta2)
# Output:
array([58.86823748, 2229.72297889])
