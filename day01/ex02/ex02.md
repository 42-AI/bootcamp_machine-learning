## Question time!

Are you able to clearly and simply explain:

1 - Why are we adding a column of ones to the examples vector/matrix when we use the linear algebra trick?   

2 - Why the cost function squares the distance between the data points and their predicted value?

3 - What represents the cost function value?

4 - Toward which value we would like the cost function to tend to ? What would it mean ?
