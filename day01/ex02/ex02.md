## Objectives:

* Reinforce the mathematical skills tackled in **Mathematical Delights**, especially the __matrix-matrix operations__.
* Be able to explain what is a fit in the machine learning context.
* Be able to implement a funcion which will perform a linear gradient descent (LGD).


## Instructions:

In this exercise you will be interested with the concept of linear gradient descent to perform fit of dataset. The linear gradient descent allows to correct the coefficients $\theta$ thanks to the gradient of the cost function.
You are expected to code a function named __fit\___ as per the instructions bellow:
``` python
def fit_(theta, X, Y, alpha, n_cycles):
	"""
	Description:
		Performs a fit of Y(output) with respect to X.
	Args:
		theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (number of features + 1, 1).
		X: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimension (number of training examples, number of features).
		Y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (number of training examples, 1).
		alpha: has to be a float, the learning rate
		n_cycles: has to be an int, the number of iterations done during the gradient descent
	Returns:
		new_theta: numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (number of the features +1,1).
		None if there is a matching dimension problem.
	Raises:
		This function should not raise any Exception.
	"""
		... your code here ...
```
Hopefully, you have already code a function to calculate the linear gradient (you might have forgot, but you really did this).


## Examples:

```python
import numpy as np
X1 = np.array([[0.], [1.], [2.], [3.], [4.]])
Y1 = np.array([[2.], [6.], [10.], [14.], [18.]])
theta1 = np.array([[1.], [1.]])
theta1 = fit_(theta1, X1, Y1, alpha = 0.01, n_cycle=2000)

theta1
# array([[2.0001..],[3.9999..]])

predict_(theta1, X1)
# array([2.0001..], [6.000..], [10.0000..], [13.9999..], [17.9999..])

X2 = np.array([[0.2, 2., 20.], [0.4, 4., 40.], [0.6, 6., 60.], [0.8, 8., 80.]])
Y2 = np.array([[19.6], [-2.8], [-25.2], [-47.6]])
theta2 = np.array([[42.], [1.], [1.], [1.]])
theta2 = fit_(theta2, X2, Y2, alpha = 0.0005, n_cycle=42000)

theta2
# array([[41.99..],[0.97..], [0.77..], [-1.20..]])

predict_(theta2, X2)
# array([[19.5992..], [-2.8003..], [-25.1999..], [-47.5996..]])
```


## Remarks :

You can generate other examples by choosing arbitrary X array and declare Y as linear expression of the X columns. Notice also that you can have the components of theta becoming "[nan]". In that case it means you probably used a too big learning rate.


## Questions :

Be sure to understand the underlying concepts and be able to answer those questions during your evaluation:
* Can you explain the different steps in the fit method (hint: you have to talk about J, the gradient and the theta)?
* What happens if you choose a too big learning rate?
* What can you say if you choose a very small learning rate and a reasonnable number of cycles?
