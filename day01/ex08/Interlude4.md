## Normalization

The value of you examples can take quite huge values (or very small ones) depending of the data you are working on.  
Such cases can force algorithms to converge very slowly to their minimum (or even sometime to not be able to converge at all). To avoid that kind of situation, normalization is a very effective way to proceed.  
  
The idea behind this technique is straightforward: **scaling the data**.  
   
With normalization, you are going to transform your data to be represented in the range [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. Your algorithm will like it and thanks you for this.
