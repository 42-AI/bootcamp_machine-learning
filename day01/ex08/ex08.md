## Question time!

Are you able to clearly and simply explain:  

1 - What is a hypothesis and what is its goal?  
(It's a second chance for you to say something intelligible, no need to thank me!)  

2 - What is the cost function and what does it represent?  

3 - What is Linear Gradient Descent and what does it do?  
(hint: you have to talk about J, its gradient and the theta parameters)  

4 - What happens if you choose a learning rate that is too large?

5 - What happens if you choose a very small learning rate and a reasonable number of cycles?

6 - Can you explain the MSE and what is it spotting ?
