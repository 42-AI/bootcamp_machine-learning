### Question time!

Are you able to clearly and simply explain:  

1 - What is a hypothesis and what is it goal? (It is a second chance to let you say something intelligible, no need to thanks me)  

2 - What is the cost function and what is it representing?  

3 - What is the linear gradient descent and what is it doing?  (hint: you have to talk about J, its gradient and the theta)?  

4 - What happens if you choose a too big learning rate ?

5 - What can you say if you choose a very small learning rate and a reasonnable number of cycles ?

6 - Can you explain the MSE and what is it spotting ?
