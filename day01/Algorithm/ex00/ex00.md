**Objective:**. 
Through the exercise you will learn what a linear model, a cost function and how to perform a linear regression.


**Instruction:**

You will model the data and plot the graph of the impact of the blue pill on the mathematical performance of a set of patient (datas reported in the __blue_pill_math.csv__).
To do so you have to implement a class called MyLinearRegression inheriting from `Regressor` similar to sklearn.linear\_model.LinearRegression.
Two methods are expected:
* **`predict(self, X)`**
* **`score(self, X, y[])`**



```python
X = numpy.array([[]])
```
