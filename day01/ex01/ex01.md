**Objectives:** 

* Reinforce the mathematical skills tackled in **Mathematical Delights**, especially the vectorized form of __Root Mean Square__ and __gradient descent__ (If you were to lazy to do it in the exercise 00 cof cof).
* Be able to perform  __linear cost function__ and the __linear gradient descent__ for a multiple features problem (and knowing what you are doing of course).

* Be able to implement vectorized methods **.fit** and **.rmse** in order to perform a full multi-linear regressions.

* Be able to visualize the different objects via graphics and extract basics informations based on its.


**Instructions:**

As you are able to perform a simple linear regression with one feature (well done!) it is time to dream bigger.
Lucky you are, we give you a new dataset with multiple features that you will find in the ressources attached.
The dataset is called __spacecraft_data.csv__ which contains the prices of spacecrafts in function of multiples features (multiple features means you will need a multi-linear model but hold on for the moment). A description of the dataset is provided in the file __data_description.txt__.

## Part One: single linear regression

As a starter, you will try to fit the data with a single linear regression and see what we get.
Thus, your hypothesis h(X) would be given by:
$$
h(X) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 \cdot X
$$

You are expected to:
* Add the method **.fit** in the class **MyLinearRegression** you started to create in the previous exercise (fit by hand is over), following the prototype:
```python
def fit(self, X, Y, alpha = 0.005, n_cycle=10000):
	"""
	Description:
		Fit the linear model by performing a gradient descent on the cost function.
	Args:
		X: __array_like__ or __sparse matrix__, shape(number of training examples, number of features)
		-> Samples(/training dataset) data from which we want to generate predicted values.
		Y: array, shape(number of training examples,)
		-> Target values of the training dataset.
		alpha:
		-> learning rate.
		n_cycle: integer
		-> number of cycling in the descent gradient the method will perform.
	Returns:
		None
	Raises:
		This method should not raise any Exception.
	"""

def rmse(self, X, Y):
	"""
	Description:
		Calculate the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) of the set of predicted values with respect to Y.
	Args:
		X: __array_like__ or __sparse matrix__, shape(number of training examples, number of features)
		-> Samples(/training dataset) from which we want to generate predicted values.
		Y: array, shape(number of training examples,)
		->
	Return:
		rmse: float.
		-> RMSE of self.predict(X) with respect to Y.
	"""
```
I strongly encourage you to code the **.fit** and **.rmse** methods in a vectorized way...

You will calcultate the score of your fits for the differents features:
**Examples**
```python
>>>import pandas as pd
>>>import numpy as np
>>>form mylinearregression import MyLinearRegression as MyLR

>>>data = pd.read_csv("spacecraft_data.csv")
>>>[...]
>>>myRL_age = MyLR(2)
>>>myRL_thrust = MyLR(2)

>>>print(myLR_age)
[theta] = [[0.0]
[ 0.0]]

>>>myLRage.fit(X[:,0].reshape(-1,1),Y)
>>>print(myLRage)
[theta] = [[798.215..]
[-19.672..]]

>>>RMSE_age = myLRage.rmse(X[:,0].reshape(-1,1),Y)
>>> print(RMSE_age)
131.935...

```

plot 6 differents graphs:
* The graph with the data, the hypothesis $h_{{\theta}}^{LGD}({X})$ obtained via linear gradient desent and $h_{{\theta}}^{NE}({X})$ (see examples figures 1a to 1c),

<img src="day01/assets/Figure_1b_price_vs_thrust.png" />

<img src="day01/assets/Figure_1c_price_vs_Tmeters.png" />


* Plot of standard deviation $\sigma$ with respect to the theta's (figures 2a, 2b and 2c).

<img src="day01/assets/Figure_2a_std_deviation_vs_age.png" />

<img src="day01/assets/Figure_2b_std_deviation_vs_thrust.png" />

<img src="day01/assets/Figure_2c_std_deviation_vs_Tmeters.png" />

Standard deviation is identical to the  RMSE which is given by the following formula:

$$
\sigma = RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{M}\sum{i=1}{M}\left(\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)}\right)^2}
$$

where $\hat{y}^{(i)}$ and $y^(i)$ are respectively the predicted output and the output with the ith training samples $x^{(i)}$.


Are the fits with a single variable are precised ? Why ? (What did I say a the beginning ?)
What the purpose to represent the RMSE in function of a feature ?


## Part Two: Multilinear Regression (A New Hope)
Now, it is time for your first multilenear regression !

As you might expected, the formula of the hyphothesis change a little and is given by:
<br>

$$
h(X)= {X} {\theta}
  =\begin{bmatrix} x_0^{(1)} & \cdots & x_N^{(1)}\\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ x_0^{(m)} & \cdots & x_N^{(m)}  \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} \theta_0 \\ \vdots \\ \theta_N\end{bmatrix}
  = \sum{i=1}{N}\theta_ix_i
$$

where ${X}$ is the training dataset matrix, ${\theta}$ the parameter's vector, m is the number of training samples and N the number of features.

But It should not change the methods you coded, hopefully !

For this part, you are expected to:
* Calculate the RMSE and compare it with the ones calculated in the previous part.

**Examples**
```python
>>>import pandas as pd
>>>import numpy as np
>>>form mylinearregression import MyLinearRegression as MyLR

>>>data = pd.read_csv("spacecraft_data.csv")
>>>[...]
>>>my_lreg = MyLR(4)
>>>my_lreg.fit(X,Y)
>>>RMSE = myLR.score(X,Y))
>>>print(RMSE)
27.5049...
```

* Plot the output and predicted output on the same graph in function of the age, thrust power and distance (see figures 3a, 3b and 3c).

## Questions:

Be sure to understand the underlying concept and be able to answer to those questions evaluators may ask:
* What is the learning rate ?
* What allows the linear gradient descent ?
* What information standard deviation gives you ?
