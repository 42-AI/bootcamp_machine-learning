**Objectives :** 

* Reinforce the mathematical skills tackled in **Mathematical Delights**, especially the __matrix-matrix operations__.
* Be able to explain what is the cost function in the machine learning context.
* Be able to implement a basic method based on the hypothesis function and output to obtain the value of the cost function.


**Instructions :**

In this exercise you will be interested with the concept of cost function usually noted J.

Th cost function is defined by the following formula:

$$
J{(\theta)}} = \frac{1}{2M}\sum_{i=1}^{M}\left(\hat{y^{(i)}} - y^{(i)}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2M}\sum_{i=1}^{M}\left(\h_{\theta}(X^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}\right)^2
$$
Where :
* $\theta$ is the coefficient vector,
* M is the number of training examples,
* $\hat{y}^{(i)}$ is the ith predicted output.
* $y^{(i)}$ is the ith real output.
* $X^{(i)}$ is the ith training examples (lign vector of $N$ components),


Then you will code the functions named __cost_elem\___ and __cost\___ as per the instructions bellow:

``` python
def cost_elem_(theta, X, Y):
	"""
	Description:
		Calculate all the elements 0.5*M*(y_pred - y)^2 of the cost function.
	Args:
		theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (number of features + 1, 1).
		X: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimension (number of training examples, number of features).
	Returns:
		J_elem: numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (number of the training examples,1).
		None if X does not match the dimension of theta.
	Raises:
		This function should not raise any Exception.
	"""
		... your code here ...

def cost_(theta, X, Y):
	"""
	Description:
		Calculate the value of cost function.
	Args:
		theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (number of features + 1, 1).
		X: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (number of training examples, number of features).
	Returns:
		J_value : has to be a float.
		None if X does not match the dimension of theta.
	Raises:
		This function should not raise any Exception.
	"""
		... your code here ...
```

**Examples :**
```python
>>>import numpy as np
>>>X1 = np.array([[0.], [1.], [2.], [3.], [4.]])
>>>theta1 = np.array([[2.], [4.]])
>>>Y1 = np.array([[2.], [7.], [12.], [17.], [22.]])
>>>cost_elem_(theta1, X1, Y1)
array([[0.], [0.1], [0.4], [0.9], [1.6]])
>>>cost_(theta1, X1, Y1)
3.0
>>>
>>>X2 = np.array([[0.2, 2., 20.], [0.4, 4., 40.], [0.6, 6., 60.], [0.8, 8., 80.]])
>>>theta2 = np.array([[0.05], [1.], [1.], [1.]])
>>>Y2 = np.array([[19.], [42.], [67.], [93.]])
>>>cost_elem_(theta2, X2, Y2)
array([[1.3203125], [0.7503125], [0.0153125], [2.1528125]])
>>>cost_(theta2, X2, Y2)
4.238750000000004
```


**Remarks :**
You may notice that the cost function is very similar to the mse (see day00).


**Questions :**
Be sure to understand the underlying concept and be able to answer to those questions during your evaluation:
* What is the cost function and what is it goal ?
* What will be the interest of the cost function derivative (you may looks few more video of the week 2 on coursera ) ?
* **Bonus (hard) question :** Are there over form of the cost function ? Cite at least 2 other definitions (with formula) of the cost function give a very short description.
