*These exercises are key assignments from the previous day. If you haven't completed them yet, you should finish them first before you continue with today's exercises.*

## Objectives:
You must implement the following formula as a function:  

$$
\begin{matrix}
J(\theta) & = & \frac{1}{2m}(\hat{y} - y)\cdot(\hat{y}- y) 
\end{matrix}
$$

Where:
- $y$ is a vector of dimension m * 1,
- $\hat{y}$ is a vector of dimension m * 1.

## Instructions:
In the cost.py file create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def cost_(y, y_hat):
    """Computes the mean squared error of two non-empty numpy.ndarray, without any for loop. The two arrays must have the same dimensions.
    Args:
      y: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector.
      y_hat: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector.
    Returns:
      The mean squared error of the two vectors as a float.
      None if y or y_hat are empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if y and y_hat does not share the same dimensions.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```

## Examples:
```python
import numpy as np
X = np.array([0, 15, -9, 7, 12, 3, -21])
Y = np.array([2, 14, -13, 5, 12, 4, -19])

# Example 1:
cost_(X, Y)
# Output:
4.285714285714286

# Example 2:
cost_(X, X)
# Output:
0.0
```
