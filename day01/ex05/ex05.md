**Objectives :** 
* Be able to explain what is a fit in the machine learning context.
* Be able to implement a funcion which will perform a linear gradient descent (LGD).


**Instructions :**
In this exercise you will be interested with the concept of linear gradient descent to perform fit of dataset. The linear gradient descent allows to correct the coefficients $\theta$ thanks to the gradient of the cost function.
You are expected to code a function named __fit\___ as per the instructions bellow:
``` python
def fit_(x, y, theta, alpha, n_cycles):
	"""
	Description:
		Performs a fit of y(output) with respect to x.
	Args:
		theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension 2 * 1.
		x: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimension m * 1: (number of training examples, 1).
		y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1: (number of training examples, 1).
		alpha: has to be a float, the learning rate
		n_cycles: has to be an int, the number of iterations done during the gradient descent
	Returns:
		new_theta: numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (number of the features +1,1).
		None if there is a matching dimension problem.
	Raises:
		This function should not raise any Exception.
	"""
		... your code here ...
```
Hopefully, you have already code a function to calculate the linear gradient.  


**Examples :**
```python
>>>import numpy as np
>>>X1 = np.array([[0.], [1.], [2.], [3.], [4.]])
>>>Y1 = np.array([[2.], [6.], [10.], [14.], [18.]])
>>>theta1 = np.array([[1.], [1.]])
>>>theta1 = fit_(X1, Y1, theta1, alpha = 0.01, n_cycle=2000)
>>>theta1
array([[2.0001..],[3.9999..]])
>>>predict_(X1, theta1)
array([2.0001..], [6.000..], [10.0000..], [13.9999..], [17.9999..])
```


**Remarks :**
You can generate other examples by choosing arbitrary x array and declare y as linear expression of the x columns. Notice also that you can have the components of theta becoming "[nan]". In that case it means you probably used a too big learning rate.


**Questions :**
Be sure to understand the underlying concepts and be able to answer those questions during your evaluation:
* Can you explain the different steps in the fit method (hint: you have to talk about J, it gradient and the theta)?
* What happens if you choose a too big learning rate ?
* What can you say if you choose a very small learning rate and a reasonnable number of cycles ?
