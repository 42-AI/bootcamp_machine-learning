**AI Classics:**   
*These exercises are key assignments from the previous day. If you haven't completed them yet, you should finish them first before you continue with today's exercises.*

## Objectives:
You must implement the following formula as a function:  

$$
\begin{matrix}
\hat{y}^{(i)} = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x^{(i)} & &\text{ for $i = 1, ..., m$}
\end{matrix}
$$  
  
Where:
- $\hat{y}^{(i)}$ is the $i^{th}$ component of vector $\hat{y}$
- $x^{(i)}$ is the $i^{th}$ component of vector $x$ 

But this time, you have to do it with the linear algebra trick!  

$$
\hat{y} = X' \cdot \theta = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & x^{(1)} \\ \vdots & \vdots \\ 1 & x^{(m)}\end{bmatrix}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}\theta_0 \\ \theta_1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \theta_0 + \theta_1 x^{(1)} \\ \vdots \\ \theta_0 + \theta_1 x^{(m)} \end{bmatrix}
$$


Be careful: 
- the $x$ you will get as an input is an $m * 1$ vector
- $\theta$ is a $2 * 1$ vector. 

You have to transform $x$ to fit the dimension of $\theta$ !

## Instructions:
In the prediction.py file, create the following function as per the instructions given below:
```python
def predict_(x, theta):
    """Computes the prediction vector y_hat from two non-empty numpy.ndarray.
    Args:
      x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimensions m * 1.
      theta: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension 2 * 1.
    Returns:
      y_hat as a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
      None if x or theta are empty numpy.ndarray.
      None if x or theta dimensions are not appropriate.
    Raises:
      This function should not raise any Exception.
    """
```

## Examples:

```python
import numpy as np
x = np.arange(1,6)

#Example 1:
theta1 = np.array([5, 0])
predict_(x, theta1)
# Ouput:
array([5., 5., 5., 5., 5.])
# Do you remember why y_hat contains only 5's here?  


#Example 2:
theta2 = np.array([0, 1])
predict_(x, theta2)
# Output:
array([1., 2., 3., 4., 5.])
# Do you remember why y_hat == x here?  


#Example 3:
theta3 = np.array([5, 3])
predict_(X, theta3)
# Output:
array([ 8., 11., 14., 17., 20.])


#Example 4:
theta4 = np.array([-3, 1])
predict_(x, theta4)
# Output:
array([-2., -1.,  0.,  1.,  2.])
```
