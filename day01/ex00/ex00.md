## Objectives: 

* Reinforce the mathematical skills tackled in **Mathematical Delights**, especially the __matrix-matrix operations__.
* Be able to explain what is a hypothesis in the machine learning context.
* Be able to implement a basic method based on the hypothesis function to obtain predicted output.


## Instructions:

First of all, you have to get familiar with the concept of feature, training set, training example, output and hypothesis.
As hypothesis function h, you will choose:

$$
\hat{y^{(i)}} = h(X^{(i)}) = \sum_{j = 0}^{N} \theta_j.x_j^{(i)}
$$

Where $X^{(i)}$ is the ith training example (line vector of $N$ components), $\theta_j$ is the jth component of the $\theta$ vector. $\hat{y}^{(i)}$ is what we called the ith predicted output.

__I would like to highlight that X is a matrix of dimension = (M,N) and theta is a matrix of dimension (N+1,1). Thus, I let you search and do what it is necessary to allow the matrix product..__

Then you will code a function named __.predict\___ as per the instructions bellow:
``` python
def predict_(theta, X):
	"""
	Description:
		Prediction of output using the hypothesis function (linear model).
	Args:
		theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (number of features + 1, 1).
		X: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimension (number of training examples, number of features).
	Returns:
		pred: numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension (number of the training examples,1).
		None if X does not match the dimension of theta.
	Raises:
		This function should not raise any Exception.
	"""
		... your code here ...
```

## Examples:

```python
import numpy as np
X1 = np.array([[0.], [1.], [2.], [3.], [4.]])
theta1 = np.array([[2.], [4.]])

predict_(theta1, X1)
# array([[2], [6], [10], [14.], [18.]])

X2 = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [5], [8]])
theta2 = np.array([[2.]])

# predict_(theta2, X2)
Incompatible dimension match between X and theta.
None

X3 = np.array([[0.2, 2., 20.], [0.4, 4., 40.], [0.6, 6., 60.], [0.8, 8., 80.]])
theta3 = np.array([[0.05], [1.], [1.], [1.]])

predict_(theta3, X3)
# array([[22.25], [44.45], [66.65], [88.85]])
```


## Questions:

Be sure to understand the underlying concepts and be able to answer those questions during your evaluation:
* What is a hypothesis and what is it goal?
* Considering a training set with 4242 examples and 3 features. How many components are there in the vector $\theta$ ?
* Considering the vector $\theta$ has a shape (6,1) and the output has the shape (7,1). What is the shape of the training set X?
