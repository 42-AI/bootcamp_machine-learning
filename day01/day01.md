# Day01 - Univariate Linear Regression

Today you will implement a method to improve your model's performance: **gradient descent**. Then you will discover the notion of normalization.

## Notions of the Day
Gradient descent, linear regression, normalization. 

## Useful Resources  
  
We strongly advise you to use the following resources:
[Machine Learning MOOC - Stanford](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/1)  

### Week 1: 

**Linear Regression with One Variable:**  

* Gradient Descent (Video + Reading)
* Gradient Descent Intuition (Video + Reading)
* Gradient Descent For Linear Regression (Video + Reading)
* Review (Reading + Quiz)

### Week 2:
**Multivariate Linear Regression**
- Gradient Descent in Practice 1 - Feature Scaling (Video + Reading)  
  
## General Rules

* The version of Python to use is 3.7, you can check the version of Python with the following command: `python -V`
* The norm: during this bootcamp you will follow the [Pep8 standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
* The function `eval` is never allowed.
* The exercises are ordered from the easiest to the hardest.
* Your exercises are going to be evaluated by someone else, so make sure that your variable names and function names are appropriate and civil. 
* Your manual is the internet.
* You can also ask questions in the `#bootcamps` channel in [42AI's Slack Workspace](https://42-ai.slack.com).
* If you find any issues or mistakes in this document, please create an issue on our dedicated [Github repository](https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_machine-learning/issues).

## Helper

Ensure that you have the right Python version.

```
> which python
/goinfre/miniconda/bin/python
> python -V
Python 3.7.*
> which pip
/goinfre/miniconda/bin/pip
```
