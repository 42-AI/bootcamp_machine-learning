# Day01 - Univariate Linear Regression

You will now implement a way to improve your model performances, using gradient descent. Then you will discover the principle of normalization.

## Notions of the day
Gradient descent, linear regression, standardization. 

## Useful Ressources  
  
We strongly advise you to use the following ressources:
[Machine Learning MOOC - Stanford](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/1)  

### Week 1: 

**Linear Regression with One Variable:**  

* Gradient Descent (Video + Reading)
* Gradient Descent Intuition (Video + Reading)
* Gradient Descent For Linear Regression (Video + Reading)
* Review (Reading + Quiz)


## General rules

* The version of Python to use is 3.7, you can check the version of Python with the following command: `python -V`
* The norm: during this bootcamp you will follow the Pep8 standards https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
* The function eval is never allowed.
* The exercises are ordered from the easiest to the hardest.
* Your exercises are going to be evaluated by someone else, so make sure that your variable names and function names are appropriate and civil. 
* Your manual is the internet.
* You can also ask questions in the dedicated channel in the 42 AI Slack: 42-ai.slack.com.
* If you find any issue or mistakes in the subject please create an issue on our dedicated repository on Github:  https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_machine-learning/issues.

## Helper

Ensure that you have the right Python version.

```
> which python
/goinfre/miniconda/bin/python
> python -V
Python 3.7.*
> which pip
/goinfre/miniconda/bin/pip
```
