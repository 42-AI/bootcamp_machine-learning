# Day01 - Linear Regression

During this day you will learn the first concepts constituting the field of machine learning.

## Notions of the day

Matrix operations, gradient descent, cost function, normal equation, MSE, RMSE R-score and learning rate. 

## General rules

* The version of Python to use is 3.7, you can check the version of Python with the following command: `python -V`
* The norm: during this bootcamp you will follow the Pep8 standards https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
* The function eval is never allowed.
* The exercises are ordered from the easiest to the hardest.
* Your exercises are going to be evaluated by someone else, so make sure that your variable names and function names are appropriate and civil. 
* Your manual is the internet.
* You can also ask questions in the dedicated channel in the 42 AI Slack: 42-ai.slack.com.
* If you find any issue or mistakes in the subject please create an issue on our dedicated repository on Github:  https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_machine-learning/issues.

## Helper 

Ensure that you have the right Python version.

```
> which python
/goinfre/miniconda/bin/python
> python -V
Python 3.7.*
> which pip
/goinfre/miniconda/bin/pip
```
